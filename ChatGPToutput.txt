Title: Chinese medicine Banxia-houpu decoction regulates c-fos expression in the brain regions in chronic mild stress model in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15103665
Abstract: Banxia-houpu decoction is a safe and effective traditional Chinese medicinal formula used in the treatment of mild and manic-depressive disorders for centuries. There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia-houpu decoction exhibited a significantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c-fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a significantly decreased c-fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no significant changes in the c-fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only significantly reduced c-fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c-fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia-houpu decoction and fluoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia-houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS-induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction.

Title: Adaptation of monoaminergic responses to phencyclidine in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex following repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468026
Abstract: The adaptive neuronal changes that follow chronic administration of antidepressant drugs are thought to underlie clinical improvement in patient populations. Recent evidence suggests that alterations specific to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may be a final common pathway to antidepressant action. To investigate this possibility, we sought to establish the effects of chronic fluoxetine or imipramine treatment on the monoamine stimulating effect of the non-competitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9/group) were treated with saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.), imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 14 consecutive days. After a 7-day drug-free period, animals given an acute challenge of either saline or phencyclidine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). One hour later, animals were killed, brains were removed, and the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens were dissected. Samples were assayed for the monoamines and their primary metabolites by HPLC. Repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine did not alter baseline dopamine or serotonin turnover. Acute phencyclidine treatment increased prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover in saline-treated animals (P<0.01); however, the effect in the nucleus accumbens was prevented in animals pretreated with imipramine or fluoxetine. Acute phencyclidine challenge also increased serotonin turnover in prefrontal cortex of saline- or imipramine-pretreated rats (P<0.01), though this effect was attenuated in animals pretreated with fluoxetine. Overall, the data suggest that repeated antidepressant treatment alters monoamine turnover in specific brain regions in response to blockade of NMDA receptors. The data highlight the importance of adaptive responses to NMDA receptors resulting from chronic antidepressant treatment.

Title: Norepinephrine transporter knock-out alters expression of the genes connected with antidepressant drugs action.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25451113
Abstract: Norepinephrine transporter knock-out mice (NET-KO) exhibit depression-resistant phenotypes. They manifest significantly shorter immobility times in both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. Moreover, biochemical studies have revealed the up-regulation of other monoamine transporters (dopamine and serotonin) in the brains of NET-KO mice, similar to the phenomenon observed after the chronic pharmacological blockade of norepinephrine transporter by desipramine in wild-type (WT) animals. NET-KO mice are also resistant to stress, as we demonstrated previously by measuring plasma corticosterone concentration. In the present study, we used a microdissection technique to separate target brain regions and the TaqMan Low Density Array approach to test the expression of a group of genes in the NET-KO mice compared with WT animals. A group of genes with altered expression were identified in four brain structures (frontal and cingulate cortices, dentate gyrus of hippocampus and basal-lateral amygdala) of NET-KO mice compared with WT mice. These genes are known to be altered by antidepressant drugs administration. The most interesting gene is Crh-bp, which modulates the activity of corticotrophin--releasing hormone (CRH) and several CRH-family members. Generally, genetic disturbances within noradrenergic neurons result in biological changes, such as in signal transduction and intercellular communication, and may be linked to changes in noradrenaline levels in the brains of NET-KO mice.

Title: Chronobiological disturbances with hyperthermia and hypercortisolism induced by chronic mild stress in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16904763
Abstract: The chronic mild stress (CMS) model has been established as a realistic model of depressive disorder as it simulates anhedonia. In the present study, the consumption of sucrose solution was decreased in the rats exposed to CMS, which coincided with many published studies. Since depression is a multifaceted disorder, and a number of symptoms may be present, including circadian rhythm disturbances, we attempted to find the chronobiological abnormalities in CMS rats. After 4-week of the stress procedure, the rhythmic pattern of rectal temperature in the CMS group was extinguished. In particular, the temperature in the CMS group in the light phase was significantly higher than that in the control group. The plasma corticosterone levels in the CMS group were remarkably increased in the light phase compared to the control group, but not in the dark phase. It was concluded that the CMS procedure caused the disturbance of circadian rhythms with hyperthermia and hypercortisolism.

Title: Genetic animal models of depression and ethanol preference provide support for cholinergic and serotonergic involvement in depression and alcoholism.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386257
Abstract: The present article summarizes some comparative studies of the Fawn-Hooded (FH) rat, a potential animal model of ethanol preference, and the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat, a potential animal model of depression. Both FH and FSL rats exhibit high degrees of immobility in the forced swim test and have difficulty learning a two-way active avoidance task. However, there were no differences between the FH and FSL rats in the elevated plus maze. Studies of ethanol preference indicated high rates of ethanol intake (greater than 4 g/kg) and preference (greater than 50%) in the FH rats, but low rates of ethanol intake (less than 1.1 g/kg) and preference (less than 20%) in FSL rats. It is concluded that the FSL rats exhibit behaviors consistent with their being an animal model of depression, whereas the FH rats exhibit features consistent with their being an animal model of both depression and alcoholism. Psychopharmacological challenges indicated that both FSL and FH rats were more sensitive to the hypothermic effects of oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist. However, FSL rats were also more sensitive to serotonergic agonists, and some of the present results and other investigators have reported serotonergic subsensitivity in the FH rats. Thus, FSL rats exhibit both cholinergic and serotonergic supersensitivity, whereas FH rats exhibit cholinergic supersensitivity but normal or reduced serotonergic sensitivity. Progeny from a genetic cross between FH and FSL rats exhibit cholinergic supersensitivity and have high ethanol preference scores. These data are consistent with genetic models suggesting that ethanol preference may be influenced by dominant genes, whereas cholinergic sensitivity may be influenced by recessive genes.

Title: Adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium ameliorates antidepression-related behaviors in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26472709
Abstract: The present study investigated the effect of adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium (ASC-CM) on behavioral disorders in 5xFAD transgenic mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests for 5xFAD mice was shorter than that for wild-type mice. Intravenous injection with ASC-CM restored the shortened immobility time for 5xFAD mice to the normal levels or to an extent, being still persistent 4 weeks after injection. ASC-CM significantly suppressed phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) at Ser9 in the hypothalamus of 5xFAD mice, without affecting Tau phosphorylation, as compared with that for control 5xFAD mice without ASC-CM injection. ASC-CM did not affect cell surface localization of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1, -2A, and -2B both in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of 5xFAD mice. The results of the present study show that ASC-CM ameliorates antidepression-related behaviors in 5xFAD mice, perhaps by inhibiting Akt and activating GSK-3β.

Title: Electrophysiological activity of raphe dorsalis serotoninergic neurones in a possible model of endogenous depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7605927
Abstract: It has been proposed that serotoninergic activity is impaired in endogenous depression. We tested this hypothesis in an experimental model, where rats which have been treated with clomipramine during the first month of life exhibit at adult age behavioural and sleep alterations which resemble the human disorder. Recording of serotoninergic neurones in the dorsal raphe nucleus revealed no modification of their spontaneous firing, but a reduced inhibitory response to the 5-HT re-uptake blocker citalopram in clomipramine-treated rats as compared to controls. This suggests that neonatal clomipramine treatment results in a long lasting desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, leading possibly to a dysregulation of 5-HT neurone activity in this proposed model of depression.

Title: Emotional memory impairments in a genetic rat model of depression: involvement of 5-HT/MEK/Arc signaling in restoration.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21242991
Abstract: Cognitive dysfunctions are common in major depressive disorder, but have been difficult to recapitulate in animal models. This study shows that Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, a genetic rat model of depression, display a pronounced impairment of emotional memory function in the passive avoidance (PA) task, accompanied by reduced transcription of Arc in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. At the cellular level, FSL rats have selective reductions in levels of NMDA receptor subunits, serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors and MEK activity. Treatment with chronic escitalopram, but not with an antidepressant regimen of nortriptyline, restored memory performance and increased Arc transcription in FSL rats. Multiple pharmacological manipulations demonstrated that procognitive effects could also be achieved by either disinhibition of 5-HT(1A)R/MEK/Arc or stimulation of 5-HT₄R/MEK/Arc signaling cascades. Taken together, studies of FSL rats in the PA task revealed reversible deficits in emotional memory processing, providing a potential model with predictive and construct validity for assessments of procognitive actions of antidepressant drug therapies.

Title: Estradiol modulates anhedonia and behavioral despair in rats and negative affect in a subgroup of women at high risk for postpartum depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23770328
Abstract: In an effort to address inconsistencies in the literature, we tested a cross-species estrogen withdrawal model of postpartum depression (PPD) with a series of rodent experiments and a prospective, naturalistic human study. All rats were ovariectomized prior to experimentation. The first rat experiment examined the effects of low- and high-dose estradiol administration and withdrawal on lateral-hypothalamic self-stimulation, a behavioral index of anhedonia, in experimental (n=7) and vehicle-only control animals (n=7). The second rat experiment examined the effects of high-dose estradiol withdrawal on activity and immobility during the forced swim test, an index of behavioral despair, in a separate group of experimental (n=8) and vehicle-only control animals (n=8). In the human study, women with (n=8) and without (n=12) a history of PPD completed mood ratings and collected saliva samples (to assess estradiol levels) daily during the third trimester of pregnancy through 10 days postpartum. The presence of PPD was assessed at one month postpartum. In the animal studies, rats in the estradiol withdrawal group demonstrated significantly greater immobility and less swimming than controls. Estradiol withdrawal resulted in reduced responding for electrical stimulation (multiple intensities) relative to estradiol administration. In the human study, there was no significant association between estradiol and negative affect among women with or without a history of PPD. However, there was a correlation between daily estradiol levels and negative affect in the women with incident PPD at one month postpartum. Despite important cross-species differences, both the rat and human studies provided evidence of the effects of estradiol on perinatal depressive symptoms.

Title: Effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Sphaeranthus indicus against experimentally induced anxiety, depression and convulsions in rodents.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20814521
Abstract: To investigate the effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of the Sphaeranthus indicus (SIE) against experimentally induced anxiety, depression and convulsions in rodents. The SIE (100, 200, 500 mg/kg, p.o.) was used in elevated plus maze, open field, forced swimming, and tail suspension tests in mice. The same doses were also used to evaluate its anticonvulsant effect on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions in rats. SIE was found to increase the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms of the maze at a dose of 100 mg/kg, p.o., indicating its anxiolytic activity. On the other hand, higher doses of SIE (200 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased open arm entries and time spent in the open arms of the maze in the elevated plus maze test indicating an absence of anxiolytic activity. However, this effect could have been related to a decrease in the locomotor activity of the mice and not to an anxiogenic effect, as indicated by the reduction in the total number of entries in the elevated plus maze. SIE also (at doses of 200 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased locomotor activity but did not affect emotional activity parameters in the open field test, suggesting a possible central nervous depressant activity. SIE also increased the immobility time in the forced swimming test at an oral dose of 500 mg/kg but did not significantly modify the activity in the tail suspension test. SIE protected rats against MES-induced convulsions and mice against PTZ-induced convulsions. Sphaeranthus indicus demonstrated anxiolytic, central nervous depressant, and anticonvulsant activities in rodents, thus supporting the folk medicinal use of this plant in nervous disorders.

Title: Paradoxical hormonal and behavioral responses to hypothyroid and hyperthyroid states in the Wistar-Kyoto rat.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11331143
Abstract: Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats show endogenous depressive behavior that can be reversed by antidepressants. Given that WKYs exhibit decreased sensitivity to some antidepressants and treatment-resistant depressed patients often show hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) dysregulation, we examined the behavioral and HPT hormonal responses of WKYs to altered thyroid status. "Euthyroid" WKYs had elevated basal plasma TSH and T(3) levels as compared to Wistars. Hypothyroidism increased TSH levels more in WKYs than in Wistars and increased response latency in the open field test (OFT) of WKYs only. Administration of T(4) and T(3) suppressed plasma TSH equally in both strains. Wistars responded to increased T(3) levels with decreased response latency and increased activity in the OFT, but increased immobility in the forced swim test. In contrast, WKYs responded only to the high T(3) levels with decreased response latency in the OFT. These results suggest the existence of a decreased central nervous system sensitivity to thyroid hormones in WKYs that could be related to their depressive behavior.

Title: Functional Uncoupling NMDAR NR2A Subunit from PSD-95 in the Prefrontal Cortex: Effects on Behavioral Dysfunction and Parvalbumin Loss after Early-Life Stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25953359
Abstract: Exposure to early-life stress increases vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. Growing evidence implicates aberrant development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the effects of early-life stress, which often emerge in adolescence or young adulthood. Specifically, early-life stress in the form of maternal separation (MS) in rodents has been shown to decrease parvalbumin (PVB)-positive interneurons in the adolescent PFC; however, the mechanism underpinning behavioral dysfunction and PVB loss is not yet known. We recently reported that MS causes overexpression of the NMDA subunit NR2A in the PFC of adolescent rats. Elevated PFC NR2A is also found in developmental models of schizophrenia and is correlated with behavioral deficits, acting largely through its association with the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. In addition, adolescent maturation of PVB-positive interneurons relies on NR2A-driven NMDA activity. Therefore, it is possible that the NR2A/PSD-95 signaling complex has a role in adolescent MS effects. Here, we aimed to determine whether a discrete manipulation of PFC NR2A could prevent MS effects on PFC-controlled behaviors, including cognition, anxiety, and novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, as well as PVB loss in adolescence. We intracranially infused the NR2A-specific blocking peptide TAT2A in order to uncouple NR2A from PSD-95 in the early-adolescent PFC, without antagonizing the NMDA receptor. We demonstrated that MS rats treated with TAT2A during early adolescence were protected from MS-induced PVB loss and exhibited less anxious behavior than those infused with control peptide. These data implicate NR2A-related N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor development in adolescent behavioral and neural consequences of early-life stress.

Title: Sex-specific antidepressant effects of dietary creatine with and without sub-acute fluoxetine in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22429992
Abstract: The potential role of metabolic impairments in the pathophysiology of depression is motivating researchers to evaluate the treatment efficacy of creatine, a naturally occurring energetic and neuroprotective compound found in brain and muscle tissues. Growing evidence is demonstrating the benefit of oral creatine supplements for reducing depressive symptoms in humans and animals. A novel question is whether dietary creatine, when combined with antidepressant drug therapy, would be more effective than either compound alone. To answer this question, four studies were conducted to investigate the behavioral effects of combined creatine and low-dose fluoxetine treatment using the forced swim test in male and female rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed powdered rodent chow supplemented with 0%, 2% or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks. Rats were injected with fluoxetine (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or saline according to a sub-acute dosing schedule. Female rats maintained on a 4% creatine diet displayed antidepressant-like effects compared to non-supplemented females prior to fluoxetine treatment. In contrast, creatine did not alter behavior reliably in males. Following drug treatment and a second forced swim trial, the antidepressant-like profile of creatine remained significant only in females co-administered 5.0 mg/kg fluoxetine. Moreover, in females only, supplementation with 4% creatine produced a more robust antidepressant-like behavioral profile compared to either dose of fluoxetine alone. Estrous cycle data indicated that ovarian hormones influenced the antidepressant-like effects of creatine. Addressing the issue of sex differences in response to treatment may affect our understanding of creatine, its relationship with depressive behavior, and may lead to sex-specific therapeutic strategies.

Title: Abnormal patterns of maternal behavior in a genetic animal model of depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811396
Abstract: The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) model is considered a genetic animal model of depression. Among other characteristics, FSL rats express stress-induced anhedonia and an abnormal dopaminergic system. Our hypothesis was that FSL rats would show abnormal maternal behaviors, especially reduced motivation to reach and care for pups and reduced licking and non-nutritive contact, based on their anhedonic characteristics. Mother-infant interactions were assessed by time limited observations in FSL and Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls. In study 1, differences were found in consummatory behaviors: FSL dams compared to SD dams showed less licking and significant decrease in non-nutritive contact from the first to the third postpartum weeks. In addition, shorter duration of nursing postures was seen in FSL compared to SD dams in the first week postpartum, and this difference was significantly increased by the third week postpartum. In study 2, after exposure to acute swim stress, differences emerged in appetitive behaviors: latencies to reach and care for pups were longer in FSL dams compared to controls, suggesting a stress-induced motivational deficit in FSL dams. Possible explanations, especially regarding the FSL dams' reward system are discussed.

Title: Antidepressant-like effect of Salvia sclarea is explained by modulation of dopamine activities in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20441789
Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to screen aromatic essential oils that have antidepressant effects to identify the regulatory mechanisms of selected essential oils.
The antidepressant effects of essential oils of Anthemis nobilis (chamomile), Salvia sclarea (clary sage; clary), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), and Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) were assessed using a forced swim test (FST) in rats. Rats were treated with essential oils by intraperitoneal injection or inhalation. Serum levels of corticosterone were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Among the essential oils tested, 5% (v/v) clary oil had the strongest anti-stressor effect in the FST. We further investigated the mechanism of clary oil antidepression by pretreatment with agonists or antagonists to serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), adrenaline, and GABA receptors. The anti-stressor effect of clary oil was significantly blocked by pretreatment with buspirone (a 5-HT(1A) agonist), SCH-23390 (a D(1) receptor antagonist) and haloperidol (a D(2), D(3), and D(4) receptor antagonist).
Our findings indicate that clary oil could be developed as a therapeutic agent for patients with depression and that the antidepressant-like effect of clary oil is closely associated with modulation of the DAnergic pathway.

Title: [The behavioral and biochemical sequelae of the removal of the olfactory bulbs in C57Bl/6j mice].
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1332299
Abstract: Ablation of the olfactory bulbs in mice C57Bl/6j was accompanied by motor and orienting-exploratory activity augmentation in the "open field" test and deterioration of the learning ability to active and passive avoidance. The most expressed behavioural changes developed in four weeks after the surgery. Chronic administration of antidepressants (amitriptyline, 20 mg/kg; trazodone, 20 mg/kg; imipramine, 10 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) normalized behaviour of bulbectomized animals, trazodone being the most effective. In the biochemical studies the brainstem serotonin level was found to be decreased and the density of 5HT2-receptors in the cerebral cortex increased in bulbectomized mice. Only trazodone was able to correct the biochemical indices. The state of the bulbectomized mice is supposed to serve a model of a depression with hypo-function of serotonergic system of the brain.

Title: Effects of long-term sertraline treatment and depression on coronary artery atherosclerosis in premenopausal female primates.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25829239
Abstract: Major depressive disorder and coronary heart disease often co-occur in the same individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for depression and other disorders, but their effects on coronary heart disease risk remain unclear. We determined the effects of an SSRI on coronary artery atherosclerosis (CAA) in an established nonhuman primate model used to clarify the association between depression and CAA.
Forty-two adult female cynomolgus macaques consuming a Western diet were characterized during an 18-month pretreatment phase and assigned to SSRI (sertraline hydrochloride 20 mg/kg, per os, once a day) or placebo balanced on pretreatment depression, body weight (BW), and iliac artery atherosclerosis extent measured via biopsy. After 18 months, CAA extent was measured using histomorphometry.
Before and during treatment, depressed monkeys had lower BW, body mass index, and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and higher heart rates during the pretreatment (p < .01) but not the treatment phase (p = .17). There were no pretreatment differences between the sertraline and placebo groups. Sertraline reduced anxious behavior but had no effect on BW, body mass index, heart rate, plasma lipids, or depression. CAA, analyzed by a 2 (depressed, nondepressed) × 2 (placebo, sertraline) × 3 (coronary arteries) analysis of covariance adjusted for pretreatment iliac atherosclerosis, was greater in depressed than in nondepressed monkeys (p < .036), and in sertraline than in placebo-treated monkeys (p = .040). The observed CAA extent in depressed monkeys treated with sertraline was 4.9 times higher than that in untreated depressed monkeys, and 6.5 times higher than that in nondepressed monkeys, on average.
Depressed animals developed more CAA, and long-term treatment with sertraline resulted in more extensive CAA.

Title: Antidepressant effect of Stillen.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25163682
Abstract: Stillen has been used to treat patients with gastric mucosal ulcers and has an anti-inflammatory effect. It is well-known that neuro-inflammatory reactions are related to depression. Here we evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of Stillen on mice subjected to the forced swimming test (FST). Stillen and eupatilin (a major component of Stillen) significantly decreased immobility times compared with the FST control group. In the Stillen-administered group, increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein were observed in the hippocampus. Nissl bodies also increased in the hippocampus neuronal cytoplasm of the Stillen-administered group. Stillen decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (at the mRNA and protein levels) in the hippocampus and serum, compared with the control group. In addition, the mRNA expression of estrogen receptor-β increased after Stillen administration in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that Stillen should be viewed as a candidate antidepressant.

Title: Epigenetic regulation of BDNF in the learned helplessness-induced animal model of depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26921875
Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common mental disorders, is a significant risk factor for suicide and causes a low quality of life for many people. However, the causes and underlying mechanism of depression remain elusive. In the current work, we investigated epigenetic regulation of BDNF in the learned helplessness-induced animal model of depression. Mice were exposed to inescapable stress and divided into learned helplessness (LH) and resilient (LH-R) groups depending on the number they failed to escape. We found that the LH group had longer immobility duration in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST), which is consistent with a depression-related phenotype. Western blotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that the LH group had lower BDNF expression than that of the LH-R group. The LH group consistently had lower BDNF mRNA levels, as detected by qPCR assay. In addition, we found BDNF exon IV was down-regulated in the LH group. Intraperitoneal injection of imipramine or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) to the LH mice for 14 consecutive days ameliorated depression-like behaviors and reversed the decrease in BDNF. The expression of HDAC5 was up-regulated in the LH mice, and a ChIP assay revealed that the level of HDAC5 binding to the promoter region of BDNF exon IV was higher than that seen in other groups. Knockdown of HDAC5 reduced depression-like behaviors in the LH mice. Taken together, these results suggest that epigenetic regulation of BDNF by HDAC5 plays an important role in the learned helplessness model of depression.

Title: Lamotrigine ameliorates seizures and psychiatric comorbidity in a rat model of spontaneous absence epilepsy.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22988820
Abstract:   Lamotrigine (LTG) is an effective clinical treatment for epilepsy associated with absence seizures. However, the impact of LTG administration in studies employing various animal models of epilepsy remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the outcomes of LTG treatment on absence seizures and comorbid anxiety and depression disorders in Long-Evans rats with spontaneous spike-wave discharges (SWDs).
  LTG (10 mg/kg) or water vehicle was chronically administered perorally to Long-Evans rats (twice daily for 35 days). Cortical activities were recorded to assess the presence of SWDs. Five behavioral tests, including the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), sucrose consumption (SC), sucrose preference, and forced swimming (FS) tests, were performed after LTG/vehicle treatment. The behavioral indexes of these tests were designed to assess anxiety (OF and EPM tests), depression (SC and FS tests), and preference for hedonistic stimuli (sugar preference test).
  Total SWD duration, SWD number, and mean SWD duration were significantly decreased in rats that received 35-day LTG treatment compared with rats that received vehicle treatment. Rats with spontaneous SWDs versus rats with no SWDs showed significant levels of anxiety and depression in the OF, EPM, and SC tests. Rats with SWDs also showed longer immobility in the FS test. However, the LTG-treated group compared with the vehicle group presented with significantly lower manifestations of anxiety and depression in the OF, EPM, SC, and sucrose preference tests and shorter immobility in the FS test.
  The results of this study suggest that chronic LTG treatment can benefit patients with epilepsy via suppression of absence seizures and amelioration of comorbid anxiety and depression.

Title: Antidepressant-like effects of serotonin type-3 antagonist, ondansetron: an investigation in behaviour-based rodent models.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18195592
Abstract: The present behavioural investigation evaluates the antidepressant potential of ondansetron (OND), a widely used (in management of cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis) 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Separate groups of mice received acute or chronic treatment of OND (0.005-1000 microg/kg), and were subjected to spontaneous locomotor activity test or antidepressant assays, namely, the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Interaction studies with fluoxetine, venlafaxine, desipramine and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin were conducted in the forced swim test. The effect of OND (0.01-1000 microg/kg) in combination with paroxetine (10 mg/kg, for 14 days) on the behaviour of male bulbectomized or sham-operated rats was also assessed. The postbulbectomy behavioural analysis included exploration in the open field and elevated plus maze. OND exhibited a biphasic dose-response profile, with antidepressant-like effects peaking at 0.1 microg/kg, in the forced swim and tail suspension tests. None of the tested doses influenced spontaneous locomotor activity. Chronic OND pretreatment augmented the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine and venlafaxine but did not influence the effects of desipramine or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin. Chronic OND (10 microg/kg) reversed hyperactivity in the open field, and decreased the percentage entry and time spent in open arms in the elevated plus maze. Summing up, it is observed that OND exhibits antidepressant-like effects, possibly mediated through postsynaptic 5-HT3 receptors.

Title: Brain responses to chronic social defeat stress: effects on regional oxidative metabolism as a function of a hedonic trait, and gene expression in susceptible and resilient rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20656462
Abstract: Chronic social defeat stress, a depression model in rats, reduced struggling in the forced swimming test dependent on a hedonic trait-stressed rats with high sucrose intake struggled less. Social defeat reduced brain regional energy metabolism, and this effect was also more pronounced in rats with high sucrose intake. A number of changes in gene expression were identified after social defeat stress, most notably the down-regulation of Gsk3b and Map1b. The majority of differences were between stress-susceptible and resilient rats. Conclusively, correlates of inter-individual differences in stress resilience can be identified both at gene expression and oxidative metabolism levels.

Abstract: Dynorphin-(1-17) (dynorphin A) significantly reduced the linear locomotion, rearing and grooming behaviors in mice using a newly devised multi-dimensional behavioral analyser. The behaviors inhibited by dynorphin A were dose-dependently antagonized by prior treatment with naloxone. The results suggest that dynorphin A-induced behavioral depression is mediated via opioid receptors in the mouse brain.

Title: Antidepressant-like effects of salidroside on olfactory bulbectomy-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and hyperactivity of HPA axis in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25101546
Abstract: Salidroside (SA) is the primary bioactive marker compound in the standardized extracts from Rhodiola rosea. Although it has potential antidepressant activity in a rat behavioral despair model, the mechanisms of antidepressant effect for SA remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant effects of SA and to discuss the potential mechanisms in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rats. SA of 20, 40 mg/kg (p.o.) for 2 weeks notably alleviated OBX-induced hyperactivity in open field test, decreased immobility time in TST and FST. Chronic treatment with SA could remarkably reduce TNF-α and IL-1β levels in hippocampus. Western blot showed that SA could markedly increase glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. Besides, SA could also attenuate corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression in hypothalamus, as well as reducing significantly the levels of serum corticosterone. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that OBX rats treated with SA could significantly improve the depressive-like behaviors. The antidepressant mechanisms of SA might be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects and the regulation of HPA axis activity. Reversal of abnormalities of GR may be partly responsible for those effects. These findings suggested that SA might become a beneficial agent to prevent and treat the depression.

Title: AGN-2979, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase activation, does not affect serotonin synthesis in Flinders Sensitive Line rats, a rat model of depression, but produces a significant effect in Flinders Resistant Line rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19463878
Abstract: The neurotransmitter, serotonin, is involved in several brain functions, including both normal, physiological functions, and pathophysiological functions. Alterations in any of the normal parameters of serotonergic neurotransmission can produce several different psychiatric disorders, including major depression. In many instances, brain neurochemical variables are not able to be studied properly in humans, thus making the use of good animal models extremely valuable. One of these animal models is the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats, which has face, predictive and constructive validities in relation to human depression. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activation inhibitor, AGN-2979, on the FSL rats (rats with depression-like behaviour), and compare it to the effect on the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) of rats used as the control rats. The effect was evaluated by measuring changes in regional serotonin synthesis in the vehicle treated rats (FSL-VEH and FRL-VEH) relative to those measured in the AGN-2979 treated rats (FSL-AGN and FRL-AGN). Regional serotonin synthesis was measured autoradiographically in more than 30 brain regions. The measurements were performed using alpha-[(14)C]methyl-l-tryptophan as the tracer. The results indicate that AGN-2979 did not produce a significant reduction of TPH activity in the AGN-2979 group relative to the vehicle group (a reduction would have been observed if there had been an activation of TPH by the experimental setup) in the FSL rats. On the other hand, there was a highly significant reduction of synthesis in the FRL rats treated by AGN-2979, relative to the vehicle group. Together, the results demonstrate that in the FSL rats, AGN-2979 does not affect serotonin synthesis. This suggests that there was no activation of TPH in the FSL rats during the experimental procedure, but such activation did occur in the FRL rats. Because of this finding, it could be hypothesized that TPH in the FSL rats cannot be easily activated. This may contribute to the development of depressive-like symptoms in the FSL rats ("depressed" rats), as they cannot easily modulate their need for elevated amounts of this neurotransmitter, and possibly other neurotransmitters. Further, because these rats represent a very good model of human depression, one can hypothesize that humans who do not have readily activated TPH may be more prone to develop depression.

Title: Increased depressive behaviour in females and heightened corticosterone release in males to swim stress after adolescent social stress in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18342957
Abstract: We previously reported that males undergoing chronic social stress (SS) (daily 1h isolation and new cage partner on days 30-45 of age) in adolescence habituated (decreased corticosterone release) to the homotypic stressor, but females did not. Here, we report that adolescent males exposed to chronic social stress had potentiated corticosterone release to a heterotypic stressor (15 min of swim stress) compared to acutely stressed and control males. The three groups of males did not differ in depressive-like behaviour (time spent immobile) during the swim stress. Corticosterone release in socially stressed females was elevated 45 min after the swim stress compared to acutely stressed and control females, and socially stressed females exhibited more depressive behaviour (longer durations of immobility and shorter durations of climbing) than the other females during the swim stress. Separate groups of rats were tested as adults several weeks after the social stress, and there were no group differences in corticosterone release after the swim stress. The only group difference in behaviour among the adults was more time spent climbing in socially stressed males than in controls. Thus, there are sex-specific effects of social stress in adolescence on endocrine responses and depressive behaviour to a heterotypic stressor, but, unlike for anxiety, substantial recovery is evident in adulthood in the absence of intervening stress exposures.

Title: Dietary restriction reverses obesity-induced anhedonia.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24518861
Abstract: Obesity-induced changes in the metabolic and endocrine milieu elicit deficits in neuroplasticity, including increased risk for development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depressive illness. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of hypothalamic insulin receptors (hypo-IRAS) elicits a phenotype that is consistent with features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and that rats with this phenotype exhibit deficits in neuronal plasticity, including depressive-like behaviors such as anhedonia. Since food restriction paradigms effectively inhibit obesity-induced neuroplasticity deficits, the aim of the current study was to determine whether food restriction could reverse obesity-induced anhedonia in hypo-IRAS rats. Compared to hypo-IRAS rats provided ad lib food access, food restriction paradigms that were initiated either prior to increases in body weight or following development of the MetS/obesity phenotype effectively restored sucrose intake in hypo-IRAS rats. Moreover, food restriction paradigms were able to prevent and reverse the changes in the endocrine/metabolic/inflammatory milieu observed in hypo-IRAS, such as increases in plasma leptin and triglyceride levels and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Collectively, these results demonstrate that obesity-induced anhedonia is a reversible process and identify some potential mechanistic mediators that may be responsible for co-morbid depression in obesity.

Title: Necessity of hippocampal neurogenesis for the therapeutic action of antidepressants in adult nonhuman primates.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21525974
Abstract: Rodent studies show that neurogenesis is necessary for mediating the salutary effects of antidepressants. Nonhuman primate (NHP) studies may bridge important rodent findings to the clinical realm since NHP-depression shares significant homology with human depression and kinetics of primate neurogenesis differ from those in rodents. After demonstrating that antidepressants can stimulate neurogenesis in NHPs, our present study examines whether neurogenesis is required for antidepressant efficacy in NHPs. MATERIALS/METHODOLOGY: Adult female bonnets were randomized to three social pens (N = 6 each). Pen-1 subjects were exposed to control-conditions for 15 weeks with half receiving the antidepressant fluoxetine and the rest receiving saline-placebo. Pen-2 subjects were exposed to 15 weeks of separation-stress with half receiving fluoxetine and half receiving placebo. Pen-3 subjects 2 weeks of irradiation (N = 4) or sham-irradiation (N = 2) and then exposed to 15 weeks of stress and fluoxetine. Dependent measures were weekly behavioral observations and postmortem neurogenesis levels.
Exposing NHPs to repeated separation stress resulted in depression-like behaviors (anhedonia and subordinance) accompanied by reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. Treatment with fluoxetine stimulated neurogenesis and prevented the emergence of depression-like behaviors. Ablation of neurogenesis with irradiation abolished the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. Non-stressed controls had normative behaviors although the fluoxetine-treated controls had higher neurogenesis rates. Across all groups, depression-like behaviors were associated with decreased rates of neurogenesis but this inverse correlation was only significant for new neurons in the anterior dentate gyrus that were at the threshold of completing maturation.
We provide evidence that induction of neurogenesis is integral to the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine in NHPs. Given the similarity between monkeys and humans, hippocampal neurogenesis likely plays a similar role in the treatment of clinical depression. Future studies will examine several outstanding questions such as whether neuro-suppression is sufficient for producing depression and whether therapeutic neuroplastic effects of fluoxetine are specific to antidepressants.

Title: Antidepressant activity of astilbin: involvement of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and BDNF signal pathway.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24681540
Abstract: Depression and related mood disorders are among the world's greatest public health problems. Previous studies have demonstrated that astilbin (AST) has broad pharmacological functions which may modulate numerous pathways, such as antioxidant, scavenging free radicals, anti-inflammatory and so on, similarly to some of other flavonoids. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of AST was investigated using chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in mice. The results showed that chronic administration of AST at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (intraperitoneally (i.p.), 21 d) reduced depressive-like behaviors of mice in the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) without affecting locomotor activity. AST increased the contents of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the frontal cortex of CUMS mice. Additionally, it was shown that AST treatment restored the CUMS-induced inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and AKT phosphorylation in the frontal cortex, conformed to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Our findings suggest that AST has antidepressant activities and the mechanisms, at least in part, relate to up-regulation of monoaminergic neurotransmitters (5-HT and DA) and activation of the BDNF signaling pathway.

Title: Anxiolytic and Antidepressant-Like Effects of the Aqueous Extract of Alafia multiflora Stem Barks in Rodents.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23125853
Abstract: The present study examined the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the aqueous extract of Alafia multiflora Stapf (AM) stem barks (150 and 300 mg/kg, 7 days administration) on rats and mice, using experimental paradigms of anxiety and depression. In the open field, the aqueous extract increased significantly the number of center square crossed and the time spent at the center of the field as well as the rearing time, while the grooming time was reduced significantly. In the elevated plus maze, the aqueous extract increased the time spent and the number of entries in the open arms. All these effects were also completely reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and pindolol a β-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT 1A/1B receptor antagonist. The time spent in the light compartment, the latency time, and the number of the light-dark transitions increased significantly in the light/dark exploration test after the treatment with AM. The extract was able to reduce significantly the immobility time and increase swimming as well as climbing duration. Taken together, the present work evidenced anxiolytic effects of the aqueous extract of AM that might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors and an antidepressant effect where noradrenergic mechanisms will probably play a role.

Title: The thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, enhances fluoxetine-induced neurogenesis in rats: possible role in antidepressant-augmenting properties.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19835665
Abstract: The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) may accelerate and augment the action of antidepressants. Antidepressants up-regulate neurogenesis in adult rodent hippocampus. We studied the effect of T3 and T3+fluoxetine in enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis beyond that induced by fluoxetine alone and the correlation with antidepressant behaviour in the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Rats were administered fluoxetine (5 mg/kg.d), T3 (50 mug/kg.d), fluoxetine (5 mg/kg.d)+T3 (50 mug/kg.d) or saline, for 21 d. Neurogenesis was studied by doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the NSFT, latency to feeding in animals deprived of food was measured. Fluoxetine and fluoxetine+T3 increased the number of doublecortin-positive (DCX+) cells in the SGZ compared to saline (p=0.00005, p=0.008, respectively). There was a trend towards an increased number of DCX+ cells by T3 compared to saline (p=0.06). Combined treatment with fluoxetine+T3 further increased the number of DCX+ cells compared to T3 or fluoxetine alone (p=0.001, p=0.014, respectively). There was no effect of any of the treatments on number of DCX+ cells in the SVZ. In the NSFT, all treatments (T3, fluoxetine+T3 and fluoxetine) reduced latency to feeding compared to saline (p=0.0004, p=0.00001, p=0.00009, respectively). Fluoxetine+T3 further reduced latency to feeding compared to T3 alone (p=0.05). The results suggest that enhancement of antidepressant action by T3 may be related to its effect of increasing hippocampal neurogenesis and that the antidepressant effect of these treatments is specific to the hippocampus and does not represent a general effect on cell proliferation.

Title: Genistein regulated serotonergic activity in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats under forced swimming stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20944428
Abstract: The mortality of individuals suffering from depression has been increasing, especially post-menopausal women; therefore, their care and treatment are important to maintain a high quality of life. In the present study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of a major isoflavonoid, genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), using a behavioral model of depression, the forced swimming test (FST), in ovariectomized rats. Daily administration of genistein to ovariectomized rats at a dosage of 10 mg/kg of body weight/d for 14 d significantly reduced the immobility time during the FST without changing motor dysfunction. On the other hand, a higher dosage, 100 mg/kg/d, did not have any effects on the immobility time compared with the vehicle control. Repeated administration of genistein at 10 mg/kg of body weight did not affect serotonergic activities in the hippocampus compared to the vehicle control in ovariectomized rats. A 5-min FST trial stimulated these activities. On the other hand, repeated pretreatment with genistein protected against changes in activity during the FST trial. These results suggest that daily consumption of genistein 10 mg/kg/d might have antidepressant-like effect on ovariectomized rats by regulating changes in serotonergic metabolism in the hippocampus under stressful conditions.

Title: Long-term behavioral changes after cessation of chronic antidepressant treatment in olfactory bulbectomized rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17141743
Abstract: Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in rats causes several behavioral and neurochemical central nervous system changes, reminiscent of symptoms of human depression. Moreover, depression-like behavior after OBX can be reversed with antidepressant drugs. However, the lasting effects of these antidepressant drugs on behavior after cessation of treatment have never been studied.
Male rats received OBX or sham surgery. After recovery, animals received 14 consecutive daily doses of imipramine (20 mg/kg), escitalopram (5 and 10 mg/kg), or vehicle. Animals were tested in an open field after acute, sub-chronic, and chronic injections, as well as 1, 2, 6, and 10 weeks after cessation of treatment.
The OBX-induced hyperactivity was normalized after sub-chronic administration of imipramine and escitalopram. Two weeks after treatment, activity of OBX animals was comparable to sham-treated animals, but after 6 weeks, OBX animals treated with both doses of escitalopram had returned to pre-treatment hyperactivity levels. The OBX animals treated with the high imipramine dose (20 mg/kg) retained activity levels comparable to sham-treated animals until 10 weeks after cessation of treatment.
Chronic but not acute administration of imipramine and escitalopram normalizes OBX-induced hyperactivity. This effect continues for up to 10 weeks after cessation of treatment in a dose dependant manner.

Title: Using chronic social stress to model postpartum depression in lactating rodents.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792810
Abstract: Exposure to chronic stress is a reliable predictor of depressive disorders, and social stress is a common ethologically relevant stressor in both animals and humans. However, many animal models of depression were developed in males and are not applicable or effective in studies of postpartum females. Recent studies have reported significant effects of chronic social stress during lactation, an ethologically relevant and effective stressor, on maternal behavior, growth, and behavioral neuroendocrinology. This manuscript will describe this chronic social stress paradigm using repeated exposure of a lactating dam to a novel male intruder, and the assessment of the behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine effects of this model. Chronic social stress (CSS) is a valuable model for studying the effects of stress on the behavior and physiology of the dam as well as her offspring and future generations. The exposure of pups to CSS can also be used as an early life stress that has long term effects on behavior, physiology, and neuroendocrinology.

Title: Viral depletion of VTA BDNF in rats modulates social behavior, consequences of intermittent social defeat stress, and long-term weight regulation.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839142
Abstract: Mesolimbic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in sustained behavioral changes following chronic social stress, and its depletion may reduce susceptibility to such behavioral alterations. Enhanced mesolimbic BDNF is proposed as pro-depressive and anhedonic, while depleting ventral tegmetal area (VTA) BDNF increases weight by enhancing hedonic eating. Here, we questioned whether depletion of VTA BDNF would alleviate social defeat stress-induced deficits in weight regulation, or affect social behavior in the presence or absence of social stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral intra-VTA infusions of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing shRNA against BDNF or a control virus. Three weeks later, rats underwent 4 episodes of social defeat stress involving exposure to an aggressive Long-Evans resident rat, or control handling every third day. Depleted VTA BDNF conferred resistance to the deficient weight regulation normally observed during intermittent social defeat stress, and enhanced long-term weight gain regardless of stress history. In addition, social approach and avoidance behavior towards a novel social target were measured 7 weeks after stress. Social defeat stress chronically reduced social behavior, whereas depletion of VTA BDNF chronically increased social behavior. Our results reveal that depletion of VTA BDNF alleviates some consequences of intermittent social defeat stress, enhances social behavior, and may contribute to weight gain. These data implicate VTA BDNF in protracted behavioral responses to stress, social stimuli, and weight regulation.

Title: Quetiapine prevents anhedonia induced by acute or chronic stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17213846
Abstract: The role of atypical antipsychotics as add-on treatments and as primary mood stabilizers in different phases of bipolar disorder is an important current research area. Although in bipolar patients the main therapeutic indication of quetiapine (QTP) is the management of acute mania, several observations suggest that this agent may exert antidepressant as well as antimanic effects. However, in our knowledge, there are no preclinical studies supporting this hypothesis. Thus, the main goal of the present work was to evaluate the putative antidepressant effect of QTP (0.4, 2.0, or 10 mg/kg/day), in comparison to amitriptyline (AMI) (2 or 5 mg/kg/day), in rats exposed to acute or chronic stress. The administration of QTP, 2 mg/kg/day, prevents the onset of anhedonia in rats exposed to a 6-week chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol. The effect of QTP has a slow onset, beginning at week 5, and causes a complete recovery from anhedonia. In this respect, the effect of QTP is similar to that obtained after chronic administration of AMI 2 or 5 mg/kg/day. Our findings also indicate that a 6-week administration of QTP, 2 or 10 mg/kg/day, has protective effects against the onset of anhedonia caused by the exposure to an acute subthreshold stressful event in rats that have previously experienced the CMS procedure. The results suggest that QTP is able to prevent both the transient mood depression caused by acute stress and the long-lasting anhedonic state induced by exposure, over a period of weeks, to a variety of unpredictable mild stressors.

Title: Estrous cycle affects the neurochemical and neurobehavioral profile of carvacrol-treated female rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21723308
Abstract: Carvacrol is the major constituent of essential oils from aromatic plants. It showed antimicrobial, anticancer and antioxidant properties. Although it was approved for food use and included in the chemical flavorings list, no indication on its safety has been estimated. Since the use of plant extracts is relatively high among women, aim of this study was to evaluate carvacrol effects on female physiology and endocrine profiles by using female rats in proestrus and diestrus phases. Serotonin and metabolite tissue content in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, after carvacrol administration (0.15 and 0.45g/kg p.o.), was measured. Drug effects in behavioral tests for alterations in motor activity, depression, anxiety-related behaviors and endocrine alterations were also investigated. While in proestrus carvacrol reduced serotonin and metabolite levels in both brain areas, no effects were observed in diestrus phase. Only in proestrus phase, carvacrol induced a depressive-like behavior in forced swimming test, without accompanying changes in ambulation. The improvement of performance in FST after subchronic treatment with fluoxetine (20mg/kg) suggested a specific involvement of serotonergic system. No differences were found across the groups with regard to self-grooming behavior. Moreover, in proestrus phase, carvacrol reduced only estradiol levels without binding hypothalamic estradiol receptors. Our study showed an estrous-stage specific effect of carvacrol on depressive behaviors and endocrine parameters, involving serotonergic system. Given the wide carvacrol use not only as feed additive, but also as cosmetic essence and herbal remedy, our results suggest that an accurate investigation on the effects of its chronic exposure is warranted.

Title: Impairments in neurogenesis are not tightly linked to depressive behavior in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24244537
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is also associated with depression. Although the precise mechanisms that lead to depression in AD are unknown, the impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis observed in AD may play a role. Adult-born neurons play a critical role in regulating both cognition and mood, and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with depression in other neurological disorders. To assess the relationship between Alzheimer's disease, neurogenesis, and depression, we studied human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, a well-characterized model of AD. We report that reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis are evident early in disease progression in hAPP mice, but a mild depressive phenotype manifests only in later stages of disease. We found that hAPP mice exhibited a reduction in BrdU-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, as well as a reduction in doublecortin-expressing cells, relative to nontransgenic controls at 5-7 months of age. These alterations in neurogenesis appeared to worsen with age, as the magnitude of reduction in doublecortin-expressing cells was greater in hAPP mice at 13-15 months of age. Only 13-15 month old hAPP mice exhibited depressive behavior in the tail suspension test. However, mice at both age groups exhibited deficits in spatial memory, which was observed in the Morris water maze test for hippocampus-dependent memory. These findings indicate that neurogenesis impairments are accompanied by cognitive deficits, but are not tightly linked to depressive behavior in hAPP mice.

Title: The quetiapine active metabolite N-desalkylquetiapine and the neurotensin NTS₁ receptor agonist PD149163 exhibit antidepressant-like effects on operant responding in male rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25285844
Abstract: Major depressive disorder is the most common mood disorder in the United States and European Union; however, the limitations of clinically available antidepressant drugs have led researchers to pursue novel pharmacological treatments. Clinical studies have reported that monotherapy with the atypical antipsychotic drug quetiapine produces a rapid reduction in depressive symptoms that is apparent after 1 week of treatment, and it is possible that the active metabolite N-desalkylquetiapine, which structurally resembles an antidepressant drug, produces antidepressant effects. Neuropharmacological evaluations of the neurotensin NTS1 receptor agonist PD149163 suggest antidepressant efficacy, but the effects of a NTS₁ receptor agonist in an antidepressant animal model have yet to be reported. The present study examined the antidepressant-like effects of N-desalkylquetiapine, PD14916, quetiapine, the tricyclic antidepressant drug imipramine, the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone, and the typical antipsychotic drug raclopride on responding in male Sprague-Dawley rats trained on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s operant schedule, a procedure used for screening antidepressant drugs. Quetiapine, PD149163, risperidone, and imipramine exhibited antidepressant-like effects by increasing the number of reinforcers earned, decreasing the number of responses emitted, and shifting the interresponse time (IRT) distributions to the right. N-Desalkylquetiapine produced a partial antidepressant-like effect by decreasing the number of responses emitted and producing a rightward shift in the IRT distributions, but it did not significantly alter the number of reinforcers earned. Raclopride decreased reinforcers and responses. These data suggest that N-desalkylquetiapine likely contributes to quetiapine's antidepressant efficacy and identify NTS₁ receptor activation as a potential novel pharmacologic strategy for antidepressant drugs.

Title: Corticotropin-releasing factor mediates the dysphoria-like state associated with alcohol withdrawal in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20193713
Abstract: This study investigated the role of CRF in the dysphoria-like state associated with alcohol withdrawal in rats. The intracranial self-stimulation procedure was used to assess brain reward thresholds. Cessation of chronic alcohol administration led to an elevation in brain reward thresholds in the alcohol dependent rats. The CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe CRF((12-41)) dose-dependently prevented the elevations in brain reward thresholds associated with alcohol withdrawal. This indicates that the dysphoria associated with alcohol withdrawal is at least partly mediated by the activation of central CRF receptors.

Title: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a result, rather than a cause, of depression under chronic stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25286230
Abstract: Although the accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression, whether Hcy is directly involved and acts as the primary cause of depressive symptoms remains unclear. The present study was designed to clarify whether increased Hcy plays an important role in stress-induced depression.
We employed the chronic unpredictable mild stress model (CUMS) of depression for 8 weeks to observe changes in the plasma Hcy level in the development of depression. The results showed that Wistar rats exposed to a series of mild, unpredictable stressors for 4 weeks displayed depression-like symptoms such as anhedonia (decreased sucrose preferences) and a decreased 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan (5-HT) concentration in the hippocampus. At the end of 8 weeks, the plasma Hcy level increased in the CUMS rats. The anti-depressant sertraline could decrease the plasma Hcy level and improve the depression-like symptoms in the CUMS rats. RhBHMT, an Hcy metabolic enzyme, could decrease the plasma Hcy level significantly, although it could not improve the depressive symptoms in the CUMS rats.
The results obtained from the experiments did not support the hypothesis that the increased Hcy concentration mediated the provocation of depression in CUMS rats, and the findings suggested that the increased Hcy concentration in the plasma might be the result of stress-induced depression.

Title: Chemical constituents and antidepressant activity of the new species Hypericum enshiense occurring in China.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19699627
Abstract: Hypericum enshiense L. H. Wu et F. S. Wang is a new species of Hypericum occurring in China, which was first identified and denominated by our laboratory. No research has been reported on the antidepressant activity and chemical constituents of this new species. In this study, the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the chemical constituents in the hydroalcoholic extract of this species were performed using HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS online method. Hypericin, pseudohypericin and some flavonoids were identified or tentatively identified. Furthermore, H. enshiense had a high content of hypericins than H. perforatum. In addition, the antidepressant activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of the species was investigated using forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The extract significantly shortened the immobility time in FST and TST, while did not alter the locomoter activity of mice. These results suggested for the first time that the hydroalcoholic extract of H. enshiense might possess potential antidepressant-like activity in the animal behavioral models, and this species might act as a new potential resource for developing antidepressants to treat depressive disorders.

Title: Cerebromicrocirculatory defects in animal model of depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6438678
Abstract: In the tetrabenazine (TBZ) model of depression, the cerebromicrocirculation was discovered to respond abnormally to metabolic demand as mimicked by the administration of CO2. Altered responsivity of cerebral blood flow and effective permeability of the blood--brain barrier to changes in PaCO2 were found. These physiologic defects coincided temporally with TBZ-induced depletion of central norepinephrine and dopamine and with the development of the behavioral effects of TBZ (the end points used to test the antidepressant potential of experimental drugs). Pretreatment with amitriptyline (a standard antidepressant and amine reuptake inhibitor) prevented the development of these TBZ-induced abnormalities in the cerebromicrocirculation, just as it prevented the behavioral effects.

Title: Cinnamomum cassia: an implication of serotonin reuptake inhibition in animal models of depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26134381
Abstract: The aim of the study was to explore the traditional use of Cinnamomum cassia against depression. The standardised methanolic extract of the bark of C. cassia was evaluated for antidepressant activity using various behavioural tests, i.e. tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST) and locomotor activity test. The serotonergic and noradrenergic modulation was assessed using 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches and yohimbine potentiation tests, respectively. The fluoxetine and phenelzine were used as positive controls in the study. The C. cassia extract significantly decreased the immobility time in TST (maximum effective dose tested was 50 mg/kg) while no effect was observed in FST and locomotor activity test. The extract significantly increased the 5-HTP-induced head twitches while yohimbine-induced lethality remained unaltered. The aforementioned results are similar to that caused by fluoxetine. The standardised methanolic extract of C. cassia demonstrated antidepressant activity that can be attributed to rise in serotonin levels.

Title: Timosaponin derivative YY-23 acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist and exerts a rapid antidepressant-like effect in mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26687936
Abstract: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor modulators have shown promising results as potential antidepressant agents, whereas timosaponins extracted from the Chinese herb Rhizoma Anemarrhenae exhibit antidepressant activities. In the present study we examined whether YY-23, a modified metabolite of timosaponin B-III, could affect NMDA receptors in rat hippocampal neurons in vitro, and evaluated its antidepressant-like effects in stressed mice.
NMDA-induced currents were recorded in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons using a whole-cell recording technique. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a 6-week chronic mild stress (CMS) or a 10-d chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The stressed mice were treated with YY-23 (20 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) or a positive-control drug, fluoxetine (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) for 3 weeks. Behavioral assessments were carried out every week.
In acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, YY-23 selectively and reversibly inhibited NMDA-induced currents with an EC50 value of 2.8 μmol/L. This inhibition of NMDA-induced currents by YY-23 was non-competitive, and had no features of voltage-dependency or use-dependency. Treatment of the stressed mice with YY-23 not only reversed CMS-induced deficiency of sucrose preference and immobility time, and CSDS-induced reduction of social interaction, but also had faster onset as compared to fluoxetine.
YY-23 is a novel non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors with promising rapid antidepressant-like effects in mouse models of CMS and CSDS depression.

Title: The effect on total renal and tubular function and plasma renin of a moderate isotonic saline load in rats anesthetized with amytal and inactin.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1180088
Abstract: The renal effects of i.v. saline loading equal to 1% body weight (b.wt.) were studied in 2 groups of rats: group I was anesthetized with Amytal (15 mg/100 g b.wt. plus supplementary doses), group II with Inactin (12.5-15.0 mg/100 g b.wt.). In group I the saline load caused an increase in urine flow (+92%), solute excretion (+67%), inulin clearance (CIN) (+24%), PAH clearance (+31%) and absolute proximal reabsorption rate (+27%). Proximal fractional reabsorption and filtration fraction (FF) remained unchanged, while plasma oncotic pressure (COP) decreased by 10%. Plasma renin fell and there was an inverse relationship between renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate. In group II urine flow and solute excretion increased after saline (+85% and 110%, respectively); CIN and absolute proximal reabsorption rate was lower than in group I and failed to increase after saline. Proximal fractional reabsorption was also lower and decreased after saline. COP as well as renin decreased as in group I, but no relationship between renin concentration and proximal reabsorption rate could be demonstrated. The data indicate that Inactin depresses both resting proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity and the tubular response to a physiological volume expansion. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the renin-angiotensin system is significantly involved in regulation of proximal tubular function, while they are incompatible with the idea that peritubular COP plays any major role in this adjustment.

Title: Possible involvement of nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of MK-801(dizocilpine), a NMDA receptor antagonist in mouse forced swim test.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18432055
Abstract: L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is an important signaling pathway involved in depression. With this information, the present study aimed to study the involvement of this signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like action of MK-801 (dizocilpine; N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist) in the mouse forced-swim test. Total immobility period was recorded in mouse forced swim test for 6 min. MK-801 (5-25 microg/kg., ip) produced a U-shaped curve in reducing the immobility period. The antidepressant-like effect of MK-801 (10 microg/kg, ip) was prevented by pretreatment with L-arginine (750 mg/kg, ip) [substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS)]. Pretreatment of mice with 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) (25 mg/kg, ip) [a specific neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor] produced potentiation of the action of subeffective dose of MK-801 (5 microg/kg, ip). In addition, treatment of mice with methylene blue (10 mg/kg, ip) [direct inhibitor of both nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase] potentiated the effect of MK-801 (5 microg/kg, ip) in the forced-swim test. Further, the reduction in the immobility period elicited by MK-801 (10 microg/kg, ip) was also inhibited by pretreatment with sildenafil (5 mg/kg, ip) [phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor]. The various modulators used in the study and their combination did not produce any changes in locomotor activity per se and in combination with MK-801. MK-801 however, at higher doses (25 microg/kg, ip) produced hyperlocomotion. The results demonstrated the involvement of nitric oxide signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of MK-801 in mouse forced-swim test.

Title: Behavioural changes during withdrawal from desmethylimipramine (DMI). II. Increased resistance to extinction.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6795662
Abstract: Rats withdrawn from chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desmethylimipramine (DMI) showed increased resistance to extinction in a runway and in continuously reinforced lever pressing. Changes were not seen in animals maintained on DMI. In acquisition, in the runway, there were no significant differences between groups; in the Skinner box, animals maintained on DMI performed worse than controls, but withdrawn animals recovered to control levels of performance. It is suggested that the effect on extinction may be mediated by a decrease in the efficacy of the dorsal noradrenaline bundle, which develops during chronic DMI treatment, but is masked by the presence of DMI. The implications of the conclusion for the " revised catecholamine hypothesis of depression" are discussed.

Title: Are serotonin transporter knockout mice 'depressed'?: hypoactivity but no anhedonia.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16951583
Abstract: Although the serotonin transporter is a key target for antidepressants, its exact role in depression etiology remains unclear. While serotonin transporter knockout mice are a potential model to examine this problem, their depression profile is unclear in several 'despair' tests, and may be confounded by their hypoactivity phenotype (confirmed here by marble-burying and bedding tests). To assess depression in these mice, we evaluated wild-type, heterozygous, and serotonin transporter knockout C57BL/6 male mice on a well-validated, anhedonia-based depression paradigm, the sucrose preference test. Overall, all three genotypes showed similar sucrose preference, indicating an unaltered hedonic state. These results demonstrate that depression-like behavior (unlike hypoactivity) is not a baseline phenotypic feature of serotonin transporter knockout mice, suggesting anew that these mice do not represent a genetic model of depression.

Title: Evaluation of potential antidepressant-like activity of chalcone-1203 in various murine experimental depressant models.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24343532
Abstract: Two classic animal behavior despair tests-the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST) were used to evaluate antidepressant-like activity of a new chalcone compound, chalcone-1203 in mice. It was observed that chalcone-1203 at dose of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST and TST in mice 30 min after treatment. In addition, chalcone-1203 was found to exhibit significant oral activity in the FST in mice. It also produced a reduction in the ambulation in the open-field test in mice not previously habituated to the arena, but no effect in the locomotor activity in mice previously habituated to the open-field. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites in mouse brain regions were also simultaneously determined by HPLC-ECD. It was found that chalcone-1203 significantly increased the concentrations of the main neurotransmitters 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. Chalcone-1203 also significantly reduced the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the hippocampus and cortex, shown down 5-HT metabolism compared with mice treated with stress vehicle. In conclusion, chalcone-1203 produced significant antidepressant-like activity, and the mechanism of action may be due to increased 5-HT and NE in the mouse hippocampus and cortex.

Title: The mechanism of antidepressant-like effects of piroxicam in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25709346
Abstract: To investigate the antidepressant-like effect of piroxicam with a focus on serotonergic neurotransmission.
Rats were randomly distributed into the following groups: 0.9% saline control; 3 mg/kg pizotifen; 10 mg/kg sertraline; 10 mg/kg piroxicam; 10 mg/kg sertraline + 10 mg/kg piroxicam; 10 mg/kg sertraline + 3 mg/kg pizotifen; and 10 mg/kg piroxicam + 3 mg/kg pizotifen. All the drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline. Three administrations of the drugs (piroxicam and sertraline) were performed 1, 5 and 24 h before testing the animals in the open field followed by the forced swim test (FST). Piroxicam and sertraline were administered orally by gavage and pizotifen was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before gavage. Immediately after the FST, the hippocampi were rapidly dissected for neurochemical analysis in high-performance liquid chromatography.
Acute treatment with piroxicam promoted an antidepressant-like effect in the FST, which was associated with an increase in serotonin levels in the hippocampus. This effect was potentiated in the piroxicam + sertraline group but counteracted by administration of the non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist pizotifen.
These results suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of piroxicam in the FST is mediated by the serotonin system; however, by different mechanisms from those of sertraline.

Title: Effect of newly synthesized 1,2,4-triazino[5,6-b]indole-3-thione derivatives on olfactory bulbectomy induced depression in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23593581
Abstract: To study the derivatives of 1,2,4-triazino[5,6-b]indole-3-thione for antidepressant activity in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rats. Out of various derivatives tested for acute tail suspension test, the two derivatives showing prominent action were selected for bilateral olfactory bulbectomy model of chronic depression in rats.
The sub acute effects of 14-day oral pretreatment of two derivatives labeled as 3a (70 mg/kg) and 3r (70 mg/kg), imipramine (20 mg/kg), fluoxetine (30 mg/kg) and moclobemide (15 mg/kg) were evaluated on bilateral bulbectomy induced rise in body weight, hyperphagia, hyperactivity, and on sexual dysfunction. The serum sodium concentration, body temperature, and heart rate were also recorded.
The derivatives 3a and 3r showed reversal of drop in body weight, reversed OBX induced hyperactivity, normalized body temperature, heart rate, and serum sodium concentration. In elevated maze test, moclobemide, 3a, 3r treatment significantly reduced time spent in open arm as compared to OBX rats. 3a and 3r also improved sexual behavior parameters.
The present study shows promising antidepressant action and provides a proof of concept for the chronic treatment of 3a, 3r to treat depression.

Title: Galanin enhances and a galanin antagonist attenuates depression-like behaviour in the rat.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16624535
Abstract: The effect of intracerebroventricular infusion of galanin and/or the galanin antagonist M35 was studied in the forced swim test. Animals were pre-exposed to water for 15 min 24 h prior to test. Immobility and climbing were assessed during the second, 5 min exposure to water. Rats receiving a single infusion of galanin (3 nmol) displayed a significant increase of immobility. This effect was blocked by co-administration of M35 (1 nmol). M35 alone (1 nmol) produced a significant decrease of immobility. The results further support the hypothesis that galanin may play a role in mood disorders, and that galanin antagonists may represent new candidates for antidepressant treatment.

Title: [Unpredictable chronic mild stress effects on antidepressants activities in forced swim test].
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26012108
Abstract: The experiments has been designed to study unpredictable chronic mild stress effect on anti-depressive activities of amitriptyline (10 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) in forced swim test in male outbred mice. It is shown that acute treatment with fluoxetine does not produce any antidepressant effects in mice following stress of 14 days while the sub-chronic injections of fluoxetine result in more deep depressive-like behavior. In 28 daily stressed mice, antidepressant effect of fluoxetine is observed independently of the injection rates. Amitriptyline demonstrates the antidepressant activity regardless of the duration of stress or administration scheduling, but at the same time the severity of anti-immobilization effect of amitriptyline in stressed mice is weaker in compare to non-stressed trails. Thus, the injection rates and duration of unpredictable mild chronic stress are the parameters that determine the efficiency of antidepressants in the mouse forced swimming test.

Title: Dopamine D-2 receptor agonist-induced behavioural depression: critical dependence upon postsynaptic dopamine D-1 function. A behavioural and biochemical study.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2573842
Abstract: The dopamine (DA) D-2 receptor agonists quinpirole (threshold dose, 0.01 mg/kg IP), pergolide (0.025 mg/kg), B-HT 920 (0.003 mg/kg) and (-)-3-PPP (4 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent locomotor depression (immobility) in mice as assessed by a subjective scoring system, with the immobility being characterized by a frozen posture. The animals were still but had their eyes open. The immobility was accompanied by reductions in sniffing, rearing and grooming. The depression (and the associated reduction in the various behaviours) produced by quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg), pergolide (0.1 mg/kg) and B-HT 920 (0.1 mg/kg) was substantially (but not always completely) reversed by the selective D-1 receptor agonist SKF38393 (up to 12 mg/kg) and the non-selective D-1 receptor agonist CY208243 (up to 3 mg/kg). The immobility induced by (-)-3-PPP (16 mg/kg) was also reversed by CY208243 and SKF38393, but the reversal was due to an increase in grooming behaviour in mice challenged with the D-1 receptor agonists, whether or not the animals had also received (-)-3-PPP. There was no reversal of the depression of rearing or sniffing. In contrast, CY208243 and SKF38393 also antagonized the immobility induced by B-HT 920, but the reversal was accompanied by at least partial reversals of the depression of sniffing, rearing and grooming. The reversal of quinpirole-induced immobility by SKF38393 and CY208243 was antagonized by SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg). The selective D-2 receptor antagonist raclopride (0.025 to 0.4 mg/kg) could not reverse quinpirole-induced immobility. High doses of either raclopride (0.4 mg/kg) or SCH23390 (greater than 0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased immobility. Although raclopride itself (0.2 mg/kg) produced a substantial increase in DOPAC and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in the striatum, it did not antagonize the autoreceptor mediated effects of quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg) in reducing the striatal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to DA ratio. However, the same dose of raclopride was partly effective in reducing the effects of lower doses of quinpirole (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) on the striatal DOPAC to DA ratio. Raclopride (0.2 mg/kg) also partially but significantly reduced the locomotor stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in reserpinized mice. Biochemical analyses in the striata indicated that CY208243 slightly retarded DA turnover (as assessed by the DOPAC/DA ratio). SKF38393 itself also slightly reduced DA turnover. In automated activity cages, using mice depleted of DA with reserpine and alpha-methyltyrosine, all the D-2 receptor agonists tested, in combination with SKF38393, produced an increase in activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title: Regulation of the galanin system by repeated electroconvulsive seizures in mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20936701
Abstract: Even though induction of seizures by electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) is a treatment widely used for major depression in humans, the working mechanism of ECS remains uncertain. The antiepileptic effect of ECS has been suggested to be involved in mediating the therapeutic effect of ECS. The neuropeptide galanin exerts antiepileptic and antidepressant-like effects and has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. To explore a potential role of galanin in working mechanisms of ECS, the present study examined effects of repeated ECS on the galanin system using QRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and [(125) I]galanin receptor binding. ECS was administered to adult mice daily for 14 days, and this paradigm was confirmed to exert antidepressant-like effect in the tail suspension test. Prominent increases in galanin gene expression were found in several brain regions involved in regulation of epileptic activity and depression, including the piriform cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and amygdala. Likewise, GalR2 gene expression was up-regulated in both the central and the medial amygdala, whereas GalR1 gene expression showed a modest down-regulation in the medial amygdala. [(125) I]galanin receptor binding in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was found to be significantly down-regulated. These data show that the galanin system is regulated by repeated ECS in a number of brain regions implicated in seizure regulation and depression. These changes may play a role in the therapeutic effect of ECS.

Title: Progesterone enhances motor, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antidepressive behavior of wild-type mice, but not those deficient in type 1 5 alpha-reductase.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15033426
Abstract: The importance of progesterone's (P(4)) metabolism by the 5 alpha-reductase type I enzyme was examined in homozygous and heterozygous 5 alpha-reductase type I knockout mice and their wild-type siblings. P(4) (1.0 mg) or vehicle was administered and effects on motor, anxiety, nociceptive, and depression behavior were observed. After testing, whole-brain progesterone and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Motor behavior in the horizontal crossing and open field tasks of 5 alpha-reductase-deficient mice administered P(4) was similar to vehicle control mice and significantly reduced compared to wild-type mice administered P(4). In the open field, 5 alpha-reductase-deficient mice administered P(4) had a similar number of central entries as did vehicle control mice, both were lower than central entries of P(4)-administered wild-type mice. However, in the plus maze, P(4) to 5 alpha-reductase-deficient or wild-type mice significantly increased open arm activity compared to vehicle-administered control mice. P(4) to wild-type, but not 5 alpha-reductase-deficient mice, significantly increased latencies to lick front and back paws in response to radiant heat stimuli compared to vehicle administration to control mice. In the forced swim test, 5 alpha-reductase-deficient mice administered P(4) were similar to vehicle control mice and the latency to immobility was significantly decreased, and the duration of immobility was significantly increased, compared to wild-type mice administered P(4). Thus, these data suggest metabolism by the 5 alpha-reductase type I enzyme may mitigate P(4)'s effects on some tasks of motor, anxiety, nociception, and depression behavior.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22698578
Abstract: Etazolate, a pyrazolopyridine class derivative is selective inhibitor of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4), an enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotide viz. cAMP & regulates cAMP signal transduction. Enhancing cAMP signal transduction by inhibition of PDE4 is known to be beneficial in depression disorders. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate thoroughly the antidepressant potential of etazolate using rodent behavioral models of depression. Acute treatment of etazolate (0.25-1 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited antidepressant-like effects in forced swim test (FST) & tail suspension test (TST) in mice without influencing the baseline locomotion in actophotometer test. Interaction studies of etazolate sub-effective dose (0.12 mg/kg, i.p.), were carried out with sub-effective dose of conventional antidepressants like fluoxetine (5mg/kg, i.p.), venlafaxine (4 mg/kg, i.p.) & desipramine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) in FST. Etazolate at sub-effective dose produced synergistic antidepressant-like effect with conventional antidepressants in the mouse FST. In addition, combined treatment of etazolate & conventional antidepressants had no significant effect on baseline locomotion. Moreover, etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) increased head twitch scores in mice & antagonized the reserpine-induced hypothermia in rats. Chronic treatment (14 days) with etazolate (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) & fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reversed the behavioral anomalies induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy in rats in modified open field exploration. In conclusion, taken together, our results suggested that etazolate exhibited antidepressant-like activity in acute & chronic rodent models of depression & deserves as a therapeutic tool that could help the conventional pharmacotherapy of depression.

Title: Antidepressant-like effects of liquiritin and isoliquiritin from Glycyrrhiza uralensis in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test in mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18289754
Abstract: Two classic animal behavior despair tests--the Forced Swimming Test (FST) and the Tail Suspension Test (TST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant activity of liquiritin and isoliquiritin from Glycyrrhiza uralensis in mice. It was observed that both liquiritin and isoliquiritin at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST and TST in mice 30 min after treatment. Measurement of locomotor activity indicated that liquiritin and isoliquiritin had no central nervous system (CNS)-stimulating effects. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites in mouse brain regions were also simultaneously determined by HPLC-ECD. It was found that these two compounds significantly increased the concentrations of the main neurotransmitters 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. Liquiritin and isoliquiritin also significantly reduced the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex, slowing down 5-HT metabolism compared with mice treated with vehicle+stress. In conclusion, liquiritin and isoliquiritin produced significant antidepressant-like effects, and their mechanism of action may be due to increased 5-HT and NE in the mouse hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex.

Title: Chronic ω-3 fatty acids supplementation promotes beneficial effects on anxiety, cognitive and depressive-like behaviors in rats subjected to a restraint stress protocol.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21192985
Abstract: Recent evidence has demonstrated dietary influence on the manifestation of different types of behaviors induced by stressor tasks. The present study examined the impact of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation in an early phase of the brain development with the goal of preventing or even attenuating the occurrence of stress-related behaviors such as depressive-like behaviors, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions in male rats subjected to restraint stress. Our results indicated that the supplementation regimen successfully counteracted the anxiogenic effects of stress as evidenced by the rats' increased exploration time in the aversive arms of the elevated plus maze. The forced swimming test indicated that immobility and swimming were more deeply influenced by PUFAs supplementation, thereby demonstrating an antidepressant effect. Furthermore, cognitive function was shown to be intensely affected by restraint stress, but the effects were surprisingly counteracted by the PUFAs supplementation. Lastly, plasmatic corticosterone levels were demonstrated to be drastically increased by the restraint stress; however, PUFAs supplementation promoted a reduction of this stress-related hormone to levels that were comparable to those observed in the control group. Our results suggested that the mechanisms underlying these effects are possibly associated with the reduction of corticosterone levels promoted by the PUFAs supplementation in the stress-induced animals. Further studies to examine the participation of PUFAs in mediating different behaviors in rats subjected to restraint stress are warranted.

Title: Negative affect and voluntary alcohol consumption in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10477053
Abstract: Based on the assumption that the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain represents an animal model for depressive behavior, the purported relationship between depression and alcohol consumption was investigated in three experiments. WKY rats consumed more alcohol than Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats when offered a choice between a 7% alcohol solution and tap water. Subsequently, the severity of stress-induced stomach ulcers was significantly less in WKY rats that had access to alcohol. In Experiment 2, WKY and S-D rats were assigned to either an alcohol access treatment or to a water-only treatment for 27 days and subsequently observed in the open-field test (OFT) and the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Access to alcohol reduced response latency in the OFT, and increased the percent time in the open arm and the total number of arm entries in the EPM for WKY rats. In Experiment 3, the antidepressant, imipramine, reduced alcohol consumption in both strains and significantly increased percent time in the open arms of the EPM for WKY rats. These studies support the assumption that depression and alcohol consumption may be related.

Title: Naproxen attenuates sensitization of depressive-like behavior and fever during maternal separation.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449392
Abstract: Early life stress can increase susceptibility for later development of depressive illness though a process thought to involve inflammatory mediators. Isolated guinea pig pups exhibit a passive, depressive-like behavioral response and fever that appear mediated by proinflammatory activity, and which sensitize with repeated separations. Treatment with an anti-inflammatory can attenuate the behavioral response during the initial separation and separation the following day. Here we used the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen to examine the role of prostaglandins in mediating the depressive-like behavior and core body temperature of young guinea pigs during an initial separation, separation the next day, and separation 10 days after the first. The passive, depressive-like behavior as well as fever sensitized with repeated separation. Three days of injection with 14 mg/kg of naproxen prior to the initial separation reduced depressive-like behavior during all three separations. A 28 mg/kg dose of naproxen, however, had minimal effect on behavior. Fever during the early separations was moderated by naproxen, but only at the higher dose. These results suggest a role of prostaglandins in the behavioral and febrile response to maternal separation, and particularly in the sensitization of depressive-like behavior following repeated separation.

Title: Antidepressant-like effect of different estrogenic compounds in the forced swimming test.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12637949
Abstract: The present study evaluated the possible antidepressant-like action of the natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E(2), 2.5-10 microg/rat), the synthetic steroidal estrogen ethinyl-estradiol (EE(2), 1.25-10.0 microg/rat), and the nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen, diethyl-stilbestrol (DES, 0.25-1.0 mg/rat) in ovariectomized adult female Wistar rats using the forced swimming test (FST). The behavioral profile induced by the estrogens was compared with that induced by the antidepressants fluoxetine (FLX, 2.5-10 mg/kg) and desipramine (DMI, 2.5-10 mg/kg). In addition, the temporal course of the antidepressant-like action of the estrogenic compounds was analyzed. FLX and DMI induced an antidepressant-like effect characterized by a reduced immobility and increased swimming for FLX and decreased immobility and increased climbing for DMI. Both E(2) and EE(2) produced a decrease in immobility and an increase in swimming, suggesting an antidepressant-like action. DES did not affect the responses in this animal model of depression at any dose tested. The time course analysis of the actions of E(2) (10 microg/rat) and EE(2) (5 microg/rat) showed that both compounds induced an antidepressant-like effect observed 1 h after their injection lasting for 2-3 days.

Title: Behavioural effects of prenatal and postnatal undernutrition in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9246914
Abstract: Effects of pre- and post-natal undernutrition on anxiety and depression paradigms were studied in albino rats. Prenatal undernutrition was induced in rat pups by restricting the dam's daily food during the gestation period whereas postnatal undernutrition in rat pups was induced by rotating them between lactating and non-lactating maternalised females daily for 12 hr during suckling period from 2nd to 18th day after birth. At 2.5 to 3 months of age all the rat pups were subjected to (i) elevated plus maze behaviour, (ii) open-field behaviour, and (iii) swimming induced behavioural despair tests. The results indicate that postnatal undernutrition caused significantly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze as well as in open-field behaviour tests. Whereas prenatal undernourishment caused lesser degree of anxiogenic behaviours in the elevated plus maze test. Prenatally undernourished rats showed increased anxiety in the open-field behaviour test. Both, pre- and post-natal undernutrition also lead to increased depressive behaviour in the behavioural despair test and postnatal undernourishment caused greater degree of behavioural despair.

Title: Pharmacological characterization of repeated corticosterone injection-induced depression model in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20813098
Abstract: Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been reported in patients with psychotic major depression (PMD), and a higher rate of cortisol hypersecretion is observed in PMD than in nonpsychotic patients. Approximately 19% of patients who meet the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) have psychotic features. Accumulated studies have indicated that repeated corticosterone (CORT) injections induce depressive behavioral and neurochemical manifestations in rodents. However, the pharmacological characterization of this model has not been fully established. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological characteristics of this model. Rats received CORT injections (20 mg/kg, subcutaneously), once per day for 21 consecutive days prior to a behavioral test. The rats were then tested for depressive behavior using a forced swimming test. The repeated CORT injections increased the immobility time in the forced swimming test, indicating an increase in depressive-like behavior. An acute treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone, counteracted the depressive-like behavior. In contrast, an acute treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluvoxamine, and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), imipramine, did not have any effect on this condition, while a combination of fluvoxamine and risperidone exerted an antidepressant-like effect. This observation is of interest in the light of the clinical findings that a combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics, but not SSRIs and TCAs, is effective for the treatment of patients with PMD. Based on previous findings and the present results, this model could be used as an animal model of PMD and may be useful for evaluating the antidepressant-like potential of compounds targeting the HPA axis.

Title: Melatonin synergizes with citalopram to induce antidepressant-like behavior and to promote hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24650119
Abstract: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is affected in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Numerous evidence indicates that plasma levels of melatonin are decreased in depressed patients. Also, melatonin exerts positive effects on the hippocampal neurogenic process and on depressive-like behavior. In addition, antidepressants revert alterations of hippocampal neurogenesis present in models of depression following a similar time course to the improvement of behavior. In this study, we analyzed the effects of both, citalopram, a widely used antidepressant, and melatonin in the Porsolt forced swim test. In addition, we investigated the potential antidepressant role of the combination of melatonin and citalopram (MLTCITAL), its type of pharmacological interaction on depressive behavior, and its effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we found decreased immobility behavior in mice treated with melatonin (<14-33%) and citalopram (<17-30%). Additionally, the MLTCITAL combination also decreased immobility (<22-35%) in comparison with control mice, reflecting an antidepressant-like effect after 14 days of treatment. Moreover, MLTCITAL decreased plasma corticosterone levels (≤13%) and increased cell proliferation (>29%), survival (>39%), and the absolute number of -associated new neurons (>53%) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These results indicate that the MLTCITAL combination exerts synergism to induce an antidepressant-like action that could be related to the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This outcome opens the opportunity of using melatonin to promote behavioral benefits and hippocampal neurogenesis in depression and also supports the use of the MLTCITAL combination as an alternative to treat depression.

Title: Effects of repeated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine treatments on mouse forced swimming.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10669904
Abstract: Studies were performed in the mouse forced swimming model, a well known experimental depression model, in order to detect the mechanism of the antidepressive effects induced by repeated serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dosing. Five-day repeat dosing of a typical SSRI, paroxetine, increased climbing, a distinctive antidepressive behavior, 1 h after but not 1 h before treatment. The coinjection of paroxetine and serum in mice treated with four repeated doses of paroxetine distinctively increased the behavior, but the coinjection of paroxetine and serum in mice without paroxetine did not. These results indicate that repeated dosing of paroxetine produces a serum substance related to the antidepressive effects induced by serotonin neuron activities. Furthermore, the behavior induced by 5-day repeated dosing of paroxetine was decreased by 100 and 10 micrograms/kg of ketanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) and 100 micrograms/kg of LY-278584 (5-HT3 antagonist). The present findings strongly suggest that repeated dosing of paroxetine produces a serum substance stimulating the antidepressive neuronal pathway sensitively mediated by 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor activity.

Title: Increased Signaling via Adenosine A1 Receptors, Sleep Deprivation, Imipramine, and Ketamine Inhibit Depressive-like Behavior via Induction of Homer1a.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26247862
Abstract: Major depressive disorder is among the most commonly diagnosed disabling mental diseases. Several non-pharmacological treatments of depression upregulate adenosine concentration and/or adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) in the brain. To test whether enhanced A1R signaling mediates antidepressant effects, we generated a transgenic mouse with enhanced doxycycline-regulated A1R expression, specifically in forebrain neurons. Upregulating A1R led to pronounced acute and chronic resilience toward depressive-like behavior in various tests. Conversely, A1R knockout mice displayed an increased depressive-like behavior and were resistant to the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation (SD). Various antidepressant treatments increase homer1a expression in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Specific siRNA knockdown of homer1a in mPFC enhanced depressive-like behavior and prevented the antidepressant effects of A1R upregulation, SD, imipramine, and ketamine treatment. In contrast, viral overexpression of homer1a in the mPFC had antidepressant effects. Thus, increased expression of homer1a is a final common pathway mediating the antidepressant effects of different antidepressant treatments.

Title: Coping with chronic social stress in mice: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/ sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis activity, behavioral changes and effects of antalarmin treatment: implications for the study of stress-related psychopathologies.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23796983
Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the individual differences that lead to the development of psychopathological changes in response to chronic social stress. We also assessed the ability of an antagonist of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptors to reverse the effects of stress. Male adult mice were exposed to repeated defeat experiences for 21 days using a sensorial contact model. After 18 days of defeat, two groups of subjects were established (active and passive), according to their behaviors during social confrontation. Antalarmin treatment was given for 4 and 6 days. The results corroborated previous data indicating that subjects who adopted a passive coping strategy had higher corticosterone levels after 21 days of defeat and decreased resting levels 3 days later. Moreover, they showed higher resting expression levels of hypothalamic CRH than their active counterparts. On day 24, the experimental animals were subjected to another social defeat to determine whether the stress response remained. The increase in corticosterone and hypothalamic CRH levels was similar for all of the stressed subjects, but the passive subjects also had a greater CRH response in the amygdala. Passive subjects had decreased levels of adrenal dopamine β-hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase and plasma adrenaline compared to the active subjects, and lower plasma noradrenaline levels than manipulated controls. The passive profile of physiological changes in both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes has been associated with changes related to mood disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. The active coping profile is characterized by similar corticosterone resting levels to controls and increased SAM activity. Both profiles showed alterations in the novel palatable and forced swimming tests, with the passive profile being the most vulnerable to the effects of stress in this last test. Pharmacological treatment with antalarmin failed to reverse the effects of stress.

Title: Differential effects of chronic unpredictable stress on hippocampal CB1 receptors in male and female rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19460405
Abstract: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS), an animal model of depression, downregulates hippocampal CB1 receptors in adult male rats. Given that endocannabinoids are implicated in modulating stress and anxiety and that women are vulnerable to stress-related disorders, we tested the effects of CMS on both female and male rats. Gonadectomized (gndx) and gonadally intact male and female rats were exposed to a three-week chronic stress protocol. Following CMS, CB1 receptor and fatty-acid-amide-hydrolase (FAAH) expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by western blot analysis. CMS reliably produced a downregulation of CB1 receptors ( approximately 50%) in the hippocampus of both gndx and intact males. This effect was more robust in the dorsal than in the ventral hippocampus. Conversely, CMS produced an upregulation of CB1 receptors ( approximately 150%) in the hippocampus of both gndx and intact females. This upregulation was only observed in the dorsal hippocampus of female animals. CMS produced an upregulation of FAAH levels in both male and female animals. In non-stress control animals, males were observed to have higher CB1 levels than females, but no differences in FAAH were found. These findings suggest that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is preferentially organized in male and female animals to respond differentially to chronic stress. These sex differences in the eCB system may help development of novel treatments for stress and depression that are designed specifically for women and men.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37338
Abstract: An investigation of the structural requirements for CNS activity of the title compounds was undertaken. A synthesis of the precursor dihydro-10H-thieno[3,4-b][1,5]benzodiazepin-10-ones was achieved and three routes for their conversion to the title compounds were developed. The compounds were tested for neuroleptic activity by means of the blockade or d-amphetamine lethality in aggregated mice and/or effects on locomotor activity in rats. Antidepressant activity was examined using inhibition of tetrabenazine-induced depression in mice. Most of the compounds were found to be potent neuroleptic agents with several exhibiting additional antidepressant activity.

Title: The impairing effect of acute ethanol on spreading depression is antagonized by astaxanthin in rats of 2 young-adult ages.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22432539
Abstract: Ethanol (EtOH) abuse and insufficient ingestion of antioxidants are external factors that can alter brain electrophysiology. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the excitability-related brain electrophysiological phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD) was facilitated by chronic EtOH intake, and chronic treatment with carotenoids attenuated this effect. Here, we investigated the acute effect of a single EtOH administration on CSD in young and adult rats previously (1 hour) treated with 10 μg/kg of astaxanthin.
Male Wistar rats (5 young- and 5 adult groups, 60 to 80 and 150 to 180 days of age, respectively) were treated by 2 gavage procedures at 1-hour interval as follows: groups 1 and 2 received astaxanthin in gavage I combined with EtOH (group 1) or water (group 2) in gavage II; groups 3 and 4 received olive oil (the vehicle in which astaxanthin was dissolved) in gavage I combined with EtOH (group 3) or water (group 4) in gavage II; group 5 received water in gavage I combined with EtOH in gavage II. CSD was recorded on the cortical surface for 4 hours.
Compared to the respective water and oil controls (groups 2 and 4; CSD velocities: 3.73 ± 0.09 and 3.78 ± 0.07 mm/min in the young groups; 2.99 ± 0.10 and 3.05 ± 0.19 mm/min in the adult groups), a single dose of EtOH (groups 3 and 5) decreased CSD propagation velocities (3.29 ± 0.23 and 3.16 ± 0.10 mm/min in the young groups; 2.71 ± 0.27 and 2.75 ± 0.31 mm/min in the adult groups). Astaxanthin antagonized the impairing effect of acute EtOH on CSD (group 1; mean velocity: 3.70 ± 0.19 and 3.13 ± 0.16 mm/min for the young and adult groups, respectively).
The results showed an antagonistic effect of acute EtOH treatment on CSD propagation that was reverted by astaxanthin. The EtOH-astaxanthin interaction was not influenced by the age, as it was found in both young and adult animals.

Title: Chronic DMI reduces thresholds for brain stimulation reward in the rat.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1924490
Abstract: The authors sought a demonstration of the validity of brain stimulation reward (BSR) models of depression. It was predicted that chronic, but not acute antidepressant treatment would enhance BSR responding. Rats with medial forebrain bundle electrodes were separated into 4 groups that received either saline or desmethylimipramine at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg daily. A rate-free, threshold measure that has not previously been employed in studies of BSR and antidepressants was used. BSR thresholds were monitored every 3rd day over a 9-day baseline period and an 18-day drug treatment period, and after 12 days of drug withdrawal. Groups did not differ from one another till the 15th and 18th day of drug treatment. The greatest effects were seen in the 10 and 20 mg groups. The 20 mg group returned to baseline after drug withdrawal, but the 10 mg group did not. The absolute size of the effect was considered to be small, leading the authors to speculate that antidepressants act on homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize BSR substrates, only indirectly enhancing transmission of the reward signal.

Title: Resident intruder paradigm-induced aggression relieves depressive-like behaviors in male rats subjected to chronic mild stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24911067
Abstract: Accumulating epidemiological evidence shows that life event stressors are major vulnerability factors for psychiatric diseases such as major depression. It is also well known that the resident intruder paradigm (RIP) results in aggressive behavior in male rats. However, it is not known how resident intruder paradigm-induced aggression affects depressive-like behavior in isolated male rats subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), which is an animal model of depression.
Male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: non-stressed controls, isolated rats subjected to the CMS protocol, and resident intruder paradigm-exposed rats subjected to the CMS protocol.
In the sucrose intake test, ingestion of a 1% sucrose solution by rats in the CMS group was significantly lower than in control and CMS+RIP rats after 3 weeks of stress. In the open-field test, CMS rats had significantly lower open-field scores compared to control rats. Furthermore, the total scores given the CMS group were significantly lower than in the CMS+RIP rats. In the forced swimming test (FST), the immobility times of CMS rats were significantly longer than those of the control or CMS+RIP rats. However, no differences were observed between controls and CMS+RIP rats.
Our data show that aggressive behavior evoked by the resident intruder paradigm could relieve broad-spectrum depressive-like behaviors in isolated adult male rats subjected to CMS.

Title: Enduring deficits in brain reward function after chronic social defeat in rats: susceptibility, resilience, and antidepressant response.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24576687
Abstract: Anhedonia, or diminished interest or pleasure in rewarding activities, characterizes depression and reflects deficits in brain reward circuitries. Social stress induces anhedonia and increases risk of depression, although the effect of social stress on brain reward function is incompletely understood.
This study assessed the following: 1) brain reward function in rats (using the intracranial self-stimulation procedure) and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and related signaling molecules in response to chronic social defeat, 2) brain reward function during social defeat and long-term treatment with the antidepressants fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day) and desipramine (10 mg/kg/day), and 3) forced swim test behavior after social defeat and fluoxetine treatment.
Social defeat profoundly and persistently decreased brain reward function, reflecting an enduring anhedonic response, in susceptible rats, whereas resilient rats showed no long-term brain reward deficits. In the ventral tegmental area, social defeat, regardless of susceptibility or resilience, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and increased phosphorylated AKT, whereas only susceptibility was associated with increased phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin. Fluoxetine and desipramine reversed lower, but not higher, stress-induced brain reward deficits in susceptible rats. Fluoxetine decreased immobility in the forced swim test, as did social defeat.
These results suggest that the differential persistent anhedonic response to psychosocial stress may be mediated by ventral tegmental area signaling molecules independent of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and indicate that greater stress-induced anhedonia is associated with resistance to antidepressant treatment. Consideration of these behavioral and neurobiological factors associated with resistance to stress and antidepressant action may promote the discovery of novel targets to treat stress-related mood disorders.

Title: Overexpression of Adenosine A2A Receptors in Rats: Effects on Depression, Locomotion, and Anxiety.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24982640
Abstract: Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) are a sub-type of receptors enriched in basal ganglia, activated by the neuromodulator adenosine, which interact with dopamine D2 receptors. Although this reciprocal antagonistic interaction is well-established in motor function, the outcome in dopamine-related behaviors remains uncertain, in particular in depression and anxiety. We have demonstrated an upsurge of A2AR associated to aging and chronic stress. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease patients present A2AR accumulation in cortical areas together with depressive signs. We now tested the impact of overexpressing A2AR in forebrain neurons on dopamine-related behavior, namely depression. Adult male rats overexpressing human A2AR under the control of CaMKII promoter [Tg(CaMKII-hA2AR)] and aged-matched wild-types (WT) of the same strain (Sprague-Dawley) were studied. The forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), and the open-field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate behavioral despair, anhedonia, locomotion, and anxiety. Tg(CaMKII-hA2AR) animals spent more time floating and less time swimming in the FST and presented a decreased sucrose preference at 48 h in the SPT. They also covered higher distances in the OFT and spent more time in the central zone than the WT. The results indicate that Tg(CaMKII-hA2AR) rats exhibit depressive-like behavior, hyperlocomotion, and altered exploratory behavior. This A2AR overexpression may explain the depressive signs found in aging, chronic stress, and Alzheimer's disease.

Title: Abnormal 5-HT modulation of stress behaviors in the Kv4.2 knockout mouse.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20801198
Abstract: The Kv4.2 gene codes for an essential subunit of voltage-gated A-type potassium channels that are involved in dendritic signal integration and synaptic plasticity. Detailed cellular characterization in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus has shown that knocking out the Kv4.2 gene increases neuronal excitability and promotes long-term potentiation. However, the overall behavioral consequences of these modifications have not been fully explored. Given the growing connection between neuronal plasticity and affect processing in the hippocampus and other Kv4.2 expressing regions, we proposed to investigate whether the absence of this gene would alter the stress response of mice to the forced swimming and tail suspension tests (TSTs) for depression-like behavior. Kv4.2 knockout (KO) mice, generated in the 129SvEv background, demonstrated elevated immobility and a loss of swimming, as well as antidepressant resistance to the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX). Characterization of a relatively new head movement behavior category, responsive to serotonergic treatment in wildtype (WT) mice, supported conclusions of abnormal 5-HT modulation. Electrophysiology recordings in the prefrontal cortex showed a blunting of postsynaptic response to direct 5-HT application following a single period of swim stress only in the animals without the Kv4.2 subunit. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that Kv4.2 KO mice may have an exaggerated 5-HT response to stress leading to a premature desensitization of postsynaptic receptors and a loss of continued behavior modulation. These results may shed some light on the involvement of A-type potassium channels in the effective action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants.

Title: Effects of imipramine on T cell subsets in olfactory bulbectomized mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12566937
Abstract: To elucidate the immunological outcome in antidepressant therapy, the effects of acute or chronic imipramine (IMP) treatment on T cell subsets were examined in sham-operated (SO) and olfactory bulbectomized (OB) mice. Olfactory bulbectomy decreased the ratio of Lyt2-positive suppressor T cells to L3T4-positive T helper cells. Acute IMP treatment did not exert any effect on the ratio in SO nor in OB mice. Chronic IMP administration was found to significantly increase the ratio in SO and OB mice and, as a result, the ratio was significantly higher in SO mice compared with the control, while the ratio was normalized in OB mice. The present study may be suggestive of the immune activation in depression and of the immunosuppressive effects of antidepressants.

Title: Neuroprotective Role of L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) against Chronic Hypobaric Hypoxia with Crowding Stress (CHC) Induced Depression-Like Behaviour.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27082990
Abstract: Improper neuroimmune responses following chronic stress exposure have been reported to cause neuronal dysfunctions leading to memory impairment, anxiety and depression like behaviours. Though several factors affecting microglial activation and consequent alteration in neuro-inflammatory responses have been well studied, role of NO and its association with microglia in stress induced depression model is yet to be explored. In the present study, we validated combination of chronic hypobaric hypoxia and crowding (CHC) as a stress model for depression and investigated the role of chronic stress induced elevated nitric oxide (NO) level in microglia activation and its effect on neuro-inflammatory responses in brain. Further, we evaluated the ameliorative effect of L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) to reverse the stress induced depressive mood state. Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rat were taken and divided into control and CHC stress exposed group with and without treatment of L-NAME. Depression like behaviour and anhedonia in rats were assessed by Forced Swim Test (FST) and Sucrose Preference Test (SPT). Microglial activation was evaluated using Iba-1 immunohistochemistry and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in the hippocampal region. Our result showed that exposure to CHC stress increased the number of active microglia with corresponding increase in inflammatory cytokines and altered behavioural responses. The inhibition of NO synthesis by L-NAME during CHC exposure decreased the number of active microglia in hippocampus as evident from decreased Iba-1 positive cells. Further, L-NAME administration decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampus and improved behaviour of rats. Our study demonstrate that stress induced elevation of NO plays pivotal role in altered microglial activation and consequent neurodegenerative processes leading to depression like behaviour in rat.

Title: Role of prefrontal cortical calcium independent phospholipase A₂ in antidepressant-like effect of maprotiline.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21835087
Abstract: There is increasing interest in the pathophysiology and neurochemistry of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in depression. Blood flow and metabolism are decreased in the PFC of patients with depression compared to controls. Changes in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are also associated with depression. This study was conducted to elucidate a possible role of PFC activity of an enzyme involved in the release of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), i.e. calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA₂), in the effects of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) antidepressant, maprotiline, in mice. Treatment of Balb/C mice with maprotiline for 4 wk resulted in reduction in the level of behavioural despair, as determined by decreased immobility and increased climbing during the forced swim test. In contrast, mice treated with maprotiline plus bilateral prefrontal cortical injections of antisense oligonucleotide to iPLA₂, showed significantly increased immobility and decreased climbing, to levels comparable to saline-treated controls, indicating abolishment of the antidepressant-like effect of maprotiline. Lipidomic analyses showed significant decreases in phosphatidylcholine species containing long-chain PUFAs and increases in lysophosphatidylcholine after maprotiline treatment, indicating increased PLA₂ activity and endogenous release of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or DHA after maprotiline treatment. These changes in lipid profiles were absent in mice that received maprotiline and PFC injections of antisense oligonucleotide to iPLA₂. Together, the results indicate that PFC iPLA₂ activity plays an important role in the antidepressant-like effect of maprotiline, possibly through endogenous release of long-chain PUFAs.

Title: Chronic mild stress and antidepressant treatment alter 5-HT1A receptor expression by modifying DNA methylation of a conserved Sp4 site.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26188176
Abstract: The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A), a critical regulator of the brain serotonergic tone, is implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD) where it is often found to be dys-regulated. However, the extent to which stress and antidepressant treatment impact 5-HT1A expression in adults remains unclear. To address this issue, we subjected adult male BALB/c mice to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to induce a depression-like phenotype that was reversed by chronic treatment with the antidepressant imipramine. In prefrontal cortex (PFC) and midbrain tissue, UCMS increased 5-HT1A RNA and protein levels, changes that are expected to decrease the brain serotonergic activity. The stress-induced increase in 5-HT1A expression was paralleled by a specific increase in DNA methylation of the conserved -681 CpG promoter site, located within a Sp1-like element. We show that the -681 CpG site is recognized and repressed by Sp4, the predominant neuronal Sp1-like factor and that Sp4-induced repression is attenuated by DNA methylation, despite a stress-induced increase in PFC Sp4 levels. These results indicate that adult life stress induces DNA methylation of a conserved promoter site, antagonizing Sp4 repression to increase 5-HT1A expression. Chronic imipramine treatment fully reversed the UCMS-induced increase in methylation of the -681 CpG site in the PFC but not midbrain of stressed animals and also increased 5-HT1A expression in the PFC of control animals. Incomplete reversal by imipramine of stress-induced changes in 5-HT1A methylation and expression indicates a persistence of stress vulnerability, and that sustained reversal of behavioral impairments may require additional pathways.

Title: Effects of stimulation and blockade of d(2) receptor on depression-like behavior in ovariectomized female rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22530139
Abstract: The aim of the present study was to explore the hedonic effects of D(2) receptor agonist, quinpirole and D(2) receptor antagonist, and sulpiride alone or in combination with a low dose of 17β-E(2)-estradiol (17β-E(2)) in the adult ovariectomized female rats (OVX). OVX rats of Wistar strain were used in all experiments. Two weeks after surgery rats were chronically treated with vehicle, a low dose of 17β-E(2) (5.0 μg/rat), quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg), sulpiride (10.0 mg/kg), quinpirole plus 17β-E(2), or sulpiride plus 17β-E(2) for 14 days before the forced swimming test. We found that sulpiride significantly decreased immobility time in the OVX females. A combination of sulpiride with a low dose of 17β-E(2) induced more profound decrease of immobility time in the OVX rats compared to the rats treated with sulpiride alone. On the contrary, quinpirole failed to modify depression-like behavior in the OVX rats. In addition, quinpirole significantly blocked the antidepressant-like effect of 17β-E(2) in OVX rats. Thus, the D(2) receptor antagonist sulpiride alone or in combination with a low dose of 17β-E(2) exerted antidepressant-like effect in OVX female rats, while the D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole produced depressant-like profile on OVX rats.

Title: Enhanced 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated behavioural responses in rats following repeated electroconvulsive shock: relevance to the mechanism of the antidepressive effect of electroconvulsive therapy.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/108733
Abstract: Treatment of rats with one electroconvulsive shock (ECS) per day for 10 days enhanced the hyperactivity syndrome produced by administration of tranylcypromine (10 mg kg-1) and L-tryptophan (50 mg kg-1) given 24 h after the final shock. Similar enhancement was seen whether the shock was alternating sinusoidal or direct current (fractionated), whether it was given through unilaterally or bilaterally placed electrodes and whether or not a neuromuscular blocking agent (fazadinium) was used. Five shocks spread over 10 days or 8 shocks spread over 17 days were similarly effective, whilst 8 shocks in 1 day were ineffective. Therefore when ECS are given to rats in ways similar to those in which electroconvulsive therapy is given to patients with depression, enhancement of behavioural responses to increased 5-HT function is produced.

Title: Microglia activation is associated with IFN-α induced depressive-like behavior.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26408795
Abstract: Inflammatory immune activation has been frequently associated with the development of major depression. This association was confirmed in patients receiving long-term treatment with pro-inflammatory interferon-α (IFN-α). Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, might serve as an important interface in this immune system-to-brain communication. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of microglia in an IFN-α mouse model of immune-mediated depression. Male BALB/c mice were treated with daily injections of IFN-α for two weeks. Depressive-like behavior was analyzed in the forced swim and tail suspension test. Activation of microglia was measured by flow cytometry. Pro-inflammatory M1 type (MHC-II, CD40, CD54, CD80, CD86, CCR7), anti-inflammatory M2 type (CD206, CD200R), and maturation markers (CD11c, CCR7) were tested, as well as the chemokine receptor CCR2. IFN-α led to a significant increase in depressive-like behavior and expression of the pro-inflammatory surface markers MHC-II, CD86, and CD54, indicating M1 polarization. Because IFN-α-treated mice showed great individual variance in the behavioral response to IFN-α, they were further divided into vulnerable and non-vulnerable subgroups. Only IFN-α vulnerable mice (characterized by their development of depressive-like behavior in response to IFN-α) showed an increased expression of MHC-II and CD86, while CD54 was similarly enhanced in both subgroups. Thus, IFN-α-induced activation of microglia was specifically associated with depressive-like behavior.

Title: Triiodothyronine potentiation of antidepressant-induced reversal of learned helplessness in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3628611
Abstract: Several clinical investigations have suggested that a special relationship exists between thyroid function and affective disorders and/or therapeutic response to antidepressants. The present report describes that the reversal by antidepressants (imipramine, desipramine, and nomifensine) of depressive-like behavior in rats (escape deficits produced by previous exposure to uncontrollable stress) was significantly hastened in animals given daily triiodothyronine (T3). The learned helplessness paradigm might be a useful model for approaching in animals the neurohormonal correlates of affective disorders and the neurobiochemical bases of the reported T3 enhancement of antidepressants.

Title: Antidepressant-like effect of D(2/3) receptor-, but not D(4) receptor-activation in the rat forced swim test.

Abstract: Dopamine plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression and therapeutic effects of antidepressants but the contribution of individual D(2)-like receptor subtypes (D(2), D(3), D(4)) to depression is not known. We present evidence that activation of D(2)/D(3), but not D(4) receptors, can affect the outcome in the rat forced swim test (FST). Nomifensine, a dopamine uptake inhibitor (7, 14, and 28 micromol/kg); quinpirole, a D(2)-like receptor and agonist (0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 micromol/kg); PD 12,8907, a preferential D(3) receptor agonist (0.17, 0.35, and 0.7 micromol/kg); PD 168077 (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 micromol/kg) and CP 226269 (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 micromol/kg), both selective D(4) receptor agonists, were administered s.c. 24, 5, and 0.5/1 h before testing. Nomifensine, quinpirole at all doses and PD 128907 at the highest dose decreased immobility time in FST. PD 168077 and CP 226269 had no effect on the model. To further clarify what type of dopamine receptors were involved in the anti-immobility effect of quinpirole, we tested different antagonists. Haloperidol, a D(2)-like receptor antagonist (0.27 micromol/kg), completely blocked the effect of quinpirole; A-437203 (LU-201640), a selective D(3) receptor antagonist (17.46 micromol/kg), showed a nonsignificant trend to attenuate the effect of the low dose of quinpirole, and L-745,870, a selective D(4) receptor antagonist (1.15 micromol/kg), had no effect. The pharmacological selectivity of the compounds tested suggests that the antidepressant-like effects of quinpirole are most likely mediated mainly by D(2) and to a lesser extent by D(3) but not D(4) receptors.

Title: Effects of the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 on the induction of learned helpless behavior in Sprague-Dawley rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8364739
Abstract: Learned helplessness (LH) is induced by exposure to an inescapable or uncontrollable stressor which results in an inability to escape or avoid the same stressor when subsequently presented in a different context. In order to understand which central mechanisms may influence the expression of the learned helpless phenotype, we have pursued an experimental approach that seeks to elucidate the behavioral effects of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones in this animal model of depression. We have previously shown that the induction of LH behavior is enhanced by adrenalectomy, an effect that is reversed by corticosterone. In this study, our aim was to attempt to locate CNS sites responsible for the observed effects of glucocorticoids on learned helpless behavior by introducing the type II GC receptor antagonist, RU 38486 to discrete brain regions. We did not observe a significant effect in LH with acute systemic, acute dentate gyrus or intracerebroventricular injection of RU 38486 in contrast to previous studies using the Porsolt swim test, another animal model of depression. However, we were able to observe a significant change upon chronic administration to the dentate gyrus. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids exert a long-term influence on stress-induced behavior, presumably by affecting glucocorticoid responsive genes in the dentate gyrus.

Title: Protective effects of chronic mild stress during adolescence in the low-novelty responder rat.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26473581
Abstract: Stress-elicited behavioral and physiologic responses vary widely across individuals and depend on a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Adolescence is an important developmental period when neural circuits that guide emotional behavior and stress reactivity are still maturing. A critical question is whether stress exposure elicits contrasting effects when it occurs during adolescence versus adulthood. We previously found that Sprague-Dawley rats selectively bred for low-behavioral response to novelty (bred Low Responders; bLRs) are particularly sensitive to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) exposure in adulthood, which exacerbates their typically high levels of spontaneous depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Given developmental processes known to occur during adolescence, we sought to determine whether the impact of CMS on bLR rats is equivalent when they are exposed to it during adolescence as compared with adulthood. Young bLR rats were either exposed to CMS or control condition from postnatal days 35-60. As adults, we found that CMS-exposed bLRs maintained high levels of sucrose preference and exhibited increased social exploration along with decreased immobility on the forced swim test compared with bLR controls. These data indicate a protective effect of CMS exposure during adolescence in bLR rats.

Title: Effects of deletion of mutant huntingtin in steroidogenic factor 1 neurons on the psychiatric and metabolic phenotype in the BACHD mouse model of Huntington disease.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25271967
Abstract: Psychiatric and metabolic features appear several years before motor disturbances in the neurodegenerative Huntington's disease (HD), caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the mechanisms leading to these aspects are unknown, dysfunction in the hypothalamus, a brain region controlling emotion and metabolism, has been suggested. A direct link between the expression of the disease causing protein, huntingtin (HTT), in the hypothalamus and the development of metabolic and psychiatric-like features have been shown in the BACHD mouse model of HD. However, precisely which circuitry in the hypothalamus is critical for these features is not known. We hypothesized that expression of mutant HTT in the ventromedial hypothalamus, an area involved in the regulation of metabolism and emotion would be important for the development of these non-motor aspects. Therefore, we inactivated mutant HTT in a specific neuronal population of the ventromedial hypothalamus expressing the transcription factor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) in the BACHD mouse using cross-breeding based on a Cre-loxP system. Effects on anxiety-like behavior were assessed using the elevated plus maze and novelty-induced suppressed feeding test. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using the Porsolt forced swim test. Effects on the metabolic phenotype were analyzed using measurements of body weight and body fat, as well as serum insulin and leptin levels. Interestingly, the inactivation of mutant HTT in SF1-expressing neurons exerted a partial positive effect on the depressive-like behavior in female BACHD mice at 4 months of age. In this cohort of mice, no anxiety-like behavior was detected. The deletion of mutant HTT in SF1 neurons did not have any effect on the development of metabolic features in BACHD mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mutant HTT regulates metabolic networks by affecting hypothalamic circuitries that do not involve the SF1 neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus.

Title: Pre- and postsynaptic serotonergic manipulations in an animal model of depression.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6968915
Abstract: Rats working on a food-reinforced operant schedule and exhibiting behavioral depression following administration of D,L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) were pretreated with one of three drugs: methysergide, fluoxetine, or amitriptyline. The former two drugs were used to establish a basis for distinguishing between pre- and postsynaptic events. We found that methysergide, a known postsynaptic blocker of serotonin, almost completely abolished the depressive effect of 5-HTP, whereas fluoxetine, a known specific uptake blocker of serotonin, potentiated the depressive effect of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) precursor. Amitriptyline, one of the commonly prescribed antidepressive drugs, reduced the behavioral depression following 5-HTP by approximately 50%. These data indicate that amitriptyline can act as an antagonist of 5-HT at the postsynaptic receptor. The results of this study, as well as those recently reported from CNS membrane binding studies, suggest that the therapeutic effects of some antidepressive drugs may be explained by their postsynaptic rather than presynaptic properties at central serotonergic receptors. Thus, these studies support the hypothesis that some types of human depression may be primarily due to an excess of free 5-HT acting at postsynaptic receptors.

Title: The Prodrug 4-Chlorokynurenine Causes Ketamine-Like Antidepressant Effects, but Not Side Effects, by NMDA/GlycineB-Site Inhibition.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26265321
Abstract: Currently approved antidepressant drug treatment typically takes several weeks to be effective. The noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has shown efficacy as a rapid-acting treatment of depression, but its use is associated with significant side effects. We assessed effects following blockade of the glycineB co-agonist site of the NMDA receptor, located on the GluN1 subunit, by the selective full antagonist 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), delivered by systemic administration of its brain-penetrant prodrug 4-chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN) in mice. Following administration of 4-Cl-KYN, 7-Cl-KYNA was promptly recovered extracellularly in hippocampal microdialysate of freely moving animals. The behavioral responses of the animals were assessed using measures of ketamine-sensitive antidepressant efficacy (including the 24-hour forced swim test, learned helplessness test, and novelty-suppressed feeding test). In these tests, distinct from fluoxetine, and similar to ketamine, 4-Cl-KYN administration resulted in rapid, dose-dependent and persistent antidepressant-like effects following a single treatment. The antidepressant effects of 4-Cl-KYN were prevented by pretreatment with glycine or the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX). 4-Cl-KYN administration was not associated with the rewarding and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine, and did not induce locomotor sensitization or stereotypic behaviors. Our results provide further support for antagonism of the glycineB site for the rapid treatment of treatment-resistant depression without the negative side effects seen with ketamine or other channel-blocking NMDA receptor antagonists.

Title: Nicotine, but not mecamylamine, enhances antidepressant-like effects of citalopram and reboxetine in the mouse forced swim and tail suspension tests.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18786574
Abstract: Current literature suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in major depression. In rodents, antidepressant-like effects of both nicotine and the non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine have been reported. Nicotine increases serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity and facilitates serotonin and noradrenaline release. Thus, we hypothesise that nicotine may enhance the behavioural effects of serotonin (e.g., citalopram) and/or noradrenaline (e.g., reboxetine) reuptake inhibitors. Here, we tested if nicotine enhanced the activity of citalopram or reboxetine in the mouse forced swim test (mFST) and the mouse tail suspension test (mTST). The potential for mecamylamine to augment antidepressant drug action was also investigated. Sub-threshold and threshold doses of citalopram (3 and 10mg/kg) or reboxetine (3, 10 and 20mg/kg) were tested alone and in combination with nicotine (0.3 and 1.0mg/kg) and mecamylamine (1 and 3mg/kg). Locomotor activity experiments were performed to rule out non-specific stimulant effects. Nicotine (1.0mg/kg) enhanced the effect of 10mg/kg citalopram and 20mg/kg reboxetine in the mFST. Similarly, nicotine (1.0mg/kg) enhanced the effect of 3 and 10mg/kg citalopram and 3 and 10mg/kg reboxetine in the mTST. No concomitant locomotor stimulation was observed at the tested dose combinations. Mecamylamine was effective on its own in some tests, but did not augment the effects of citalopram or reboxetine at the doses tested. The data show that nicotine enhances the effects of both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, possibly reflecting nicotine's facilitating effects on the release of these two neurotransmitters, and indicating that nicotine may enhance antidepressant action.

Title: Effect of antidepressant drugs on 6-OHDA-treated mice in the FST.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16757155
Abstract: There is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine could be indirectly involved in the appearance of behavioural effects of antidepressants. In this study, we induced a partial (over 70%) and non-reversible depletion of dopamine-containing neurons in mice by i.c.v. infusion of 6-OHDA. Then, we compared the antidepressant-like effect of drugs (citalopram, paroxetine, desipramine and imipramine) with or without dopamine depletion in the mice forced swimming test. Our results clearly show that lesion with 6-OHDA does not modify the response of mice to desipramine and imipramine, whereas dopamine depletion abolished the antidepressant-like effect of citalopram and paroxetine. It could then be suggested that antidepressant-like effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and citalopram) in the mice FST requires the activation of dopaminergic pathways to occur.

Title: Antidepressant Effect of Cnestis ferruginea Vahl ex DC (Connaraceae): Involvement of Cholinergic, Monoaminergic and L-arginine-nitric Oxide Pathways.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26789652
Abstract: We have previously reported antidepressant effect of Cnestis ferruginea (CF) in behavioral models of depression. Due to the promise shown by this extract, this study was carried out to investigate the contribution of monoaminergic, cholinergic and nitrergic systems to the antidepressant-like effect elicited by CF.
Male albino mice were pretreated with monoaminergic or cholinergic receptor antagonists, L-arginine or N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) (at doses reported to block the in vivo effect of the agonists), 15 min before oral administration of CF (100 mg/kg), 1 h later, the forced swim test (FST) in mice was carried out.
CF treatment produced significant changes in the duration of swimming (F(5,42)=9.86, P<0.001), climbing behaviour (F(5,42)=4.51, P=0.004) and mean time spent immobile (F(5,42)=11.55, P<0.001) vs. vehicle-treated control. Co-administration of CF with fluoxetine or imipramine potentiated their effect. However, pretreatment of mice with reserpine (F(1,16)=119.20, P<0.001), prazosin (F(1,16)=68.98, P<0.001), sulpiride (F(1,16)=15.46, P<0.01), RS 127445 ((F(1,20)=8.22, P<0.01), SB 399885 ((F(1,20)=38.44, P<0.001), atropine (F(1,16)=53.77, P<0.001), or L-arginine (nitric oxide precursor) (F(1,16)=10.35, P<0.01) prevented CF-induced antidepressant-like effect in mice. In addition, pretreatment of mice with L-NNA (10 mg/kg) augmented the effect of CF.
C. ferruginea exerts its antidepressant-like action through interaction with α-adrenoceptor, dopamine D2, 5-HT2B, 5-HT6 and muscarinic cholinergi1c receptors as well as L-arginine-nitric oxide systems. C. ferruginea could be used as adjuvant with conventional antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Title: Acute treatment with methotrexate induces hippocampal dysfunction in a mouse model of breast cancer.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22796103
Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is a well-known cytostatic agent used in adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, that has neurological side effects, including depression and cognitive impairment. We investigated the neurotoxic effects of MTX on the hippocampus and hippocampus-dependent behaviors in breast cancer cell line (FM3A)-inoculated tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we evaluated the changes in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the hippocampus of tumor-bearing mice after treatment with MTX. Depressive-like behavior test (tail-suspension test, TST) and learning and memory tasks (passive avoidance) were administered 24h after MTX (40 mg/kg, i.p.) injection. MTX-treated tumor-bearing mice showed significant depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. Treatment with MTX significantly decreased the number of doublecortin (a marker for immature progenitor neurons)-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, treatment with MTX significantly upregulated proinflammatory enzymes, including iNOS and COX-2, in tumor-bearing mice. These findings indicate that the acute neurotoxic effect of MTX leads to hippocampal dysfunction including depressive-like behaviors and memory deficits, which may be related to an inhibition of neurogenesis and an increase of the inflammatory response in the hippocampus of a mouse model of breast cancer.

Abstract: Rats isolated at 16--18 days of age showed after 10--12 months a complex behavioural syndrome in which locomotor activity was markedly increased when compared to that of group-housed controls. The hyperactivity of the socially deprived animals was selectively blocked by clinically effective antidepressants but not by other classes of psychotropic drugs. The present animal model may be of value for the detection of new antidepressants and contribute to elucidate the aetiology of depression.

Title: Neuroprotective effect of chronic verapamil treatment on cognitive and noncognitive deficits in an experimental Alzheimer's disease in rats.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9522258
Abstract: It is well known that disturbance of calcium homeostasis has a significant role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent data suggest that acute treatment with the calcium antagonist verapamil can improve some behavioral deficits in an experimental model of AD. Therefore, the present study was done to establish the effect of chronically administered verapamil on cognitive and noncognitive behavior of rats with bilateral electrolitical lesions of nucleus basalis manocellularis (NBM)--an animal model of AD. The NBM lesions produce a deficit in performance of diverse behavior tests: active avoidance (AA), low level of fear (the open field test) as well as aggressive (the test of foot-shock induced aggression) and depressive (the learned helplessness test) behavior. Verapamil (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg i.p.) or saline solution (1 ml/kg i.p.) were injected 24 hr after the lesion of NBM and then repeatedly administered during the next 8 days (twice a day). Performance of the two-way active avoidance test, the open field test, the foot shock-induced aggression test and the learned helplessness test were done on day 4 after the last verapamil or saline treatment (day 13 after the lesion). Verapamil in doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg significantly ameliorated the deficit in the performance of AA, the open field behavior, and the depression, but not the aggressive behavior. The obtained beneficial effect of chronic administered verapamil suggests that the regulation of calcium homeostasis during the early period after NBM lesions might be a reasonable way to prevent the behavioral deficits in an experimental model of AD.

Title: Differential regulation of corticosteroid receptors by monoamine neurotransmitters and antidepressant drugs in primary hippocampal culture.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12732243
Abstract: Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a characteristic feature of depressive illness. The centrally located corticosteroid receptors, the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, are thought to be important modulators of this axis and changes in the levels of these receptors, particularly in the hippocampus, may underlie the hyperactivity observed. Various antidepressant drugs increase hippocampal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor levels in vivo. These effects are thought to be mediated via alterations in monoaminergic neurotransmission. We examined whether serotonin (5HT) and noradrenaline (NA) have direct effects on glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in primary hippocampal neurones, and whether antidepressants also exert direct effects on target neurones. Exposure of hippocampal cells to 5HT for 4 days increased both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein expression. The induction of mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA was completely blocked by the 5HT(7) receptor antagonist SB 269970. In contrast glucocorticoid receptor induction was insensitive to the 5HT(7) receptor, whilst studies with the 5HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-proplamino) tetralin hydrochloride and the 5HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-2-[O-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY 100635) suggest a partial role for 5HT(1A) receptors in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor regulation. Treatment with NA for 4 days also increased glucocorticoid receptor expression but had no effect on mineralocorticoid receptor expression. This was blocked by propanolol suggesting action via beta-adrenergic receptors. Similarly to NA, fluoxetine and amitriptyline also selectively increased glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein levels over this time course. However, glucocorticoid receptor induction by fluoxetine or amitriptyline was not blocked by WAY 100635 or propanolol. These results show that 5HT, NA and antidepressants act directly but via distinct mechanisms on hippocampal neurones to regulate mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor expression. Thusly, manipulation of neurotransmitter or antidepressant levels in the brain may aid in reversing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity by restoring hippocampal corticosteroid receptor balance.

Title: Alterations in phospholipidomic profile in the brain of mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814727
Abstract: Depression is a worldwide disability disease associated with high morbidity and has increased dramatically in the last few years. The differential diagnosis and the definition of an individualized therapy for depression are hampered by the absence of specific biomarkers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the phospholipidomic profile of the brain and myocardium in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The lipidomic profile was evaluated by thin layer and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and lipid oxidation was estimated by FOX II assay. Antioxidant enzyme activity and the oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio were also evaluated. Results showed that chronic stress affects primarily the lipid profile of the brain, inducing an increase in lipid hydroperoxides, which was not detected in the myocardium. A significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and in cardiolipin (CL) relative contents and also oxidation of CL and a significant increase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were observed in the brain of mice after unpredictable chronic stress conditions. In the myocardium only an increase in PC content was observed. Nevertheless, both organs present a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio when compared to control groups, corroborating the occurrence of oxidative stress. The enzyme activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were found to be decreased in the myocardium and increased in the brain, while glutathione reductase (GR) was decreased in the brain. Our results indicate that in a mouse model for studying depression induced by CUS, the modification of the expression of oxidative stress-related enzymes did not prevent lipid oxidation in organs, particularly in the brain. These observations suggest that depression has an impact on the brain lipidome and that further studies are needed to better understand lipids role in depression and to evaluate their potential as future biomarkers.

Title: Small-molecule inhibitors at the PSD-95/nNOS interface have antidepressant-like properties in mice.
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23446451
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors are as efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants in preclinical antidepressant screening procedures and in attenuating behavioural deficits associated with animal models of depression. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) complex gates Ca(2+), which interacts with calmodulin to subsequently activate NO synthase. We hypothesised that uncoupling neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the NMDA-R through the scaffolding protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) would produce behavioural antidepressant effects similar to NO synthase inhibitors. Small-molecule inhibitors of the PSD-95/nNOS interaction, IC87201 (0.01-2 mg/kg) and ZL006 (10 mg/kg) were tested for antidepressant properties in tests of antidepressant activity namely the tail suspension and forced swim tests in mice. We now report that IC87201 and ZL006 produce antidepressant-like responses in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) following a single administration in mice. By contrast to the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (25 mg/kg), the effects are not observed 1 h following drug administration but are apparent 24 and 72 h later. Furthermore prior exposure to the TST or FST is required in order to observe the antidepressant-related activity. Similar delayed and sustained antidepressant-like effects were observed following TRIM (50 mg/kg) and ketamine (30 mg/kg) in the TST. The antidepressant-like effects of ZL006 also generalise to IC87201 in the TST. IC87201 was devoid of effects on locomotor activity and step-through latency in the passive avoidance cognition test. These data support the hypothesis that targeting the PSD-95/nNOS interaction downstream of NMDA-R produces antidepressant effects and may represent a novel class of therapeutics for major depressive disorders.

Prompt Template: 
Conduct a systematic review on animal depression. I provide the title and abstract for one journal article. Provide an overall assessment based on eligibility criteria with only one word answer  yes or no with no explanation. Then, for each inclusion or exclusion criterion, answer with only one word, yes if it is included by the inclusion criterion or excluded by the exclusion criterion, and answer no if it does not meet the inclusion criterion or not excluded by the exclusion criterion. After answering all the criteria with yes or no, then provide an overall explanation.
Here is the eligibility criteria:
Inclusion Criteria: 1. Any article providing primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype with an appropriate control group (specified above). 2. Animals of all ages, sexes and species, where depression-like phenotype intended to mimic the human condition have been induced. Including animal models where depressive-like phenotypes are induced in the presence of a comorbidity (e.g. obesity or cancer). 3. All studies that claim to model depression or depressive-like phenotypes in animals. Studies that induce depressive behaviour or model depression and that also test a treatment or intervention (prior or subsequent to model induction), with no exclusion criteria based on dosage, timing or frequency. 4. Studies measuring behavioural, anatomical and structural, electrophysiological, histological and/or neurochemical outcomes and where genomic, proteomic or metabolomic outcomes are measured in addition to behavioural, anatomical, electrophysiological, histological or neurochemical outcomes.Exclusion Criteria: 1. Review article, editorials, case reports, letters or comments, conference or seminar abstracts, studies providing primary data but not appropriate control group. 2. Human studies and ex vivo, in vitro or in silico studies. Studies will be excluded if authors state an intention to induce or investigate only anxiety or anxious behaviour. Studies will be excluded if there is no experimental intervention on the animals (e.g. purely observational studies). 3. Studies that investigate treatments or interventions, but no depressive behaviour or model of depression is induced (e.g. toxicity and side-effect studies). 4. Where metabolic outcome measures are the primary outcome measure of a study. Where genomic, proteomic, metabolic or metabolomic outcomes are the sole outcome measures in a study, they will be excluded.

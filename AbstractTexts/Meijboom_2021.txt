PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30739183
Abstract: Infliximab is increasingly used to treat neurosarcoidosis. We aimed to determine the efficacy and tolerance of an infliximab biosimilar for treating neurosarcoidosis.
We conducted a retrospective single-center study to describe the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of an infliximab biosimilar in neurosarcoidosis patients. We compared the survival time without relapse while receiving the biosimilar or previous originator-infliximab treatment.
Twenty patients with histologically documented neurosarcoidosis were treated with an infliximab biosimilar (initiation of treatment in 12 and switch from the originator drug in 8) between February 2016 and August 2018. All patients presenting with neurological involvement of one or more areas, including meningeal (n = 15), cerebral (n = 10), spinal cord (n = 9), and/or cranial nerves (n = 5); epilepsy (n = 3); and/or intracranial hypertension (n = 3) were enrolled. Eighteen patients received glucocorticoids during infliximab treatment, and 16 had methotrexate or azathioprine concomitant treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 25 months (19-28). Six patients relapsed during biosimilar treatment. Relapse rates and time-to-relapse did not differ between the infliximab originator previously received and biosimilar treatment groups (p = 0.40 and 0.51, respectively). Nine patients experienced 11 adverse events with the infliximab biosimilar, including infections (n = 5), urticaria (n = 4), headache (n = 1), and diarrhea (n = 1). All side effects were grade 2 or less using the WHO classification.
In this retrospective study, the infliximab biosimilar was efficacious and safe for treating neurosarcoidosis.

Abstract 2. Title: Biosimilar Infliximab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Outcomes of a Managed Switching Programme.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28130330
Abstract: Biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 offers the potential for large drug acquisition cost savings. However, there are limited published data regarding its efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], particularly in switching IBD patients from originator to biosimilar infliximab. We present the outcomes of a service evaluation of switching IBD patients established on originator infliximab to biosimilar, using a managed switching programme funded via a gain share agreement in a UK teaching hospital.
Evaluation outcomes included drug persistence, changes in drug acquisition costs, patient-reported side effects, adverse events, patient outcomes assessed using the IBD-control Patient-Reported Outcome Measures [PROM] questionnaire, serum drug and antibody levels, and routinely collected biochemical markers.
A total of 143 patients with IBD [118 Crohn's disease, 23 ulcerative colitis, 2 IBD unclassified] were switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13. Patients reported a similar incidence of side effects before and after switch. No clinically significant differences were observed in mean C-reactive protein [CRP], albumin, haemoglobin levels, or platelet and white cell counts after the switch to CT-P13, whereas mean IBD-control-8 score improved from 10.4 to 11.2 [p = 0.041]. There was no significant difference in drug persistence between biosimilar and originator infliximab [p = 0.94] and no increase in immunogenicity was found. Drug acquisition costs decreased by £40,000-60,000 per month.
A managed switching programme from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 in IBD, using a gain-share agreement, delivers significant cost savings and investment in clinical services while maintaining similar patient-reported outcomes, biochemical response, drug persistence, and adverse event profile.

Abstract 3. Title: Efficacy and safety of a single switch from etanercept originator to etanercept biosimilar in a cohort of inflammatory arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-30
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999362
Abstract: AntiTNF-α biosimilars are broadly available for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. There are a lot of data concerning the maintenance of clinical efficacy after switching from originators to biosimilars; therefore, such a transition is increasingly encouraged both in the US and Europe. However, there are reports about flares and adverse events (AE) as a non-medical switch remains controversial due to ethical and clinical implications (efficacy, safety, tolerability). The aim of our work was to evaluate the disease activity trend after switching from etanercept originator (oETA-Enbrel) to its biosimilar (bETA-SP4/Benepali) in a cohort of patients in Turin, Piedmont, Italy. In this area, the switch to biosimilars is stalwartly encouraged. We switched 87 patients who were in a clinical state of stability from oETA to bETA: 48 patients were affected by Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),26 by Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and 13 by Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS).We evaluated VAS-pain, Global-Health, CRP, number of swollen and tender joints, Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28) for RA, Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) for PsA, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Health Assessment Questionnaire for the spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S),Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for AS patients. 11/85 patients (12.6%) stopped treatment after switching to biosimilar etanercept. No difference was found between oETA and bETA in terms of efficacy. However, some arthritis flare and AE were reported. Our data regarding maintenance of efficacy and percentage of discontinuation were in line with the existing literature.

Abstract 4. Title: Long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P13, a biosimilar of infliximab, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A retrospective multicenter study.
Publication Date: 2019-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30828891
Abstract: A biosimilar of infliximab, CT-P13 (Remsima®) has the potential to reduce treatment costs and enhance access to biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, long-term clinical data on its use for IBD treatment are currently sparse. We aimed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P13 therapy in a large, real-life IBD cohort.
A total of 368 IBD patients (227 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 141 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) treated with CT-P13 at 16 referral hospitals in Korea between July 2012 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed.
The cumulative retention rates at years 1, 3, and 5 were 86.1%, 68.5%, and 58.7% and 69.7%, 46.0%, and 26.7% in anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve CD and UC patients, respectively. The clinical response and remission rates at week 14 and at years 1, 3, and 5 were 94.3%, 92.7%, 76.8%, and 17.6% and 78.6%, 82.4%, 72.2%, and 17.6% in anti-TNF-naïve CD and 85.6%, 80.0%, 55.2%, and 6.7% and 42.6%, 59.8%, 44.2%, and 6.7% in anti-TNF-naïve UC patients, respectively. Among patients who switched from the biologic originator to CT-P13, the cumulative retention rates at years 1, 3, and 5 were 88.5%, 66.1%, and 44.8% in CD, and 73.9%, 42.5%, and 42.5% in UC patients, respectively. Significant improvements in disease activity scores were accompanied by marked reductions in inflammatory marker levels, and no unexpected adverse events including death or malignancy occurred during the study period.
Long-term treatment with CT-P13 is effective in inducing and maintaining disease improvement and is well-tolerated in patients with IBD. CT-P13 may be a promising treatment option for IBD.

Abstract 5. Title: Maintained Clinical Remission in Ankylosing Spondylitis Patients Switched from Reference Infliximab to Its Biosimilar: An 18-Month Comparative Open-Label Study.
Publication Date: 2019-Jul-02
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31269678
Abstract: Switching from reference infliximab (RI) to biosimilar infliximab (BI) had no detrimental effects on efficacy and safety. However, long-term follow-up data is missing.
To evaluate patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) in clinical remission who were switching from RI to BI, in terms of the safety and efficacy of this, in a long-term fashion.
One hundred and nine consecutive unselected AS patients were investigated. All were naïve to other biologics and were followed-up at predefined times receiving RI. Patients in clinical remission were asked to switch from RI to BI. Those who switched to BI were compared with a matched control-group receiving continuous RI. During follow-up, several parameters were recorded for at least 18 months. Disease activity was measured using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), and the Ankylosing Spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS), using the C-reactive protein. Remission was defined as BASDAI < 4 and ASDAS < 1.3.
Eighty-eight patients were evaluated (21 excluded for different reasons). From those, 45 switched to BI, while 43 continued receiving RI. No differences between groups regarding demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were observed. All patients were in clinical remission. During follow-up, five patients from the BI-group and three from the maintenance-group discontinued the study (4 patients nocebo effect, 1 loss of efficacy). After 18 months of treatment, all patients in both groups remained in clinical remission. No significant adverse events were noted between groups.
BI is equivalent to RI in maintaining AS in clinical remission for at least 18 months.

Abstract 6. Title: To switch or not to switch: results of a nationwide guideline of mandatory switching from originator to biosimilar etanercept. One-year treatment outcomes in 2061 patients with inflammatory arthritis from the DANBIO registry.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30396903
Abstract: Real-world evidence on effectiveness of switching to biosimila r etanercept is scarce. In Denmark, a nationwide guideline of mandatory switch from 50 mg originator (ETA) to biosimilar (SB4) etanercept was issued for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) in 2016. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were studied in ETA-treated patients, who switched to SB4 (switchers) or maintained ETA (non-switchers). Retention rates were compared with that of a historic cohort of ETA-treated patients. Switchers who resumed ETA treatment (back-switchers) were characterised.
Observational cohort study based on the DANBIO registry. Treatment retention was explored by Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression (crude, adjusted).
1621 (79%) of 2061 ETA-treated patients switched to SB4. Disease activity was unchanged 3 months' preswitch/postswitch. Non-switchers often received 25 mg ETA (ETA 25 mg pens/syringes and powder solution were still available). One-year adjusted retention rates were: non-switchers: 77% (95% CI: 72% to 82%)/switchers: 83% (79% to 87%)/historic cohort: 90% (88% to 92%). Patients not in remission had lower retention rates than patients in remission, both in switchers (crude HR 1.7 (1.3 to 2.2)) and non-switchers (2.4 (1.7 to 3.6)). During follow-up, 120 patients (7% of switchers) back-switched to ETA. Back-switchers' clinical characteristics were similar to switchers, and reasons for SB4 withdrawal were mainly subjective.
Seventy-nine per cent of patients switched from ETA to SB4. After 1 year, adjusted treatment retention rates were lower in switchers versus the historic ETA cohort, but higher than in non-switchers. Withdrawal was more common in patients not in remission. The results suggest that switch outcomes in routine care are affected by patient-related factors and non-specific drug effects.

Abstract 7. Title: Are Patients at Risk for Recurrent Disease Activity After Switching From Remicade<sup>®</sup> to Remsima<sup>®</sup>? An Observational Study.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32850911
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Since the late '90s, infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) is being used successfully to treat patients with several non-infectious immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). In recent years, infliximab biosimilars, including Remsima<sup>®</sup> were introduced in clinical practice. <b>Aim:</b> To investigate the interchangeability of Remicade<sup>®</sup> (originator infliximab) and its biosimilar Remsima<sup>®</sup> in patients with rare immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). <b>Methods:</b> This two-phased prospective open label observational study was designed to monitor the transition from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to Remsima<sup>®</sup> in patients with rare IMIDs. All included patients were followed during the first 2 years. The primary endpoint was the demonstration of non-difference in quality of life and therapeutic efficacy, as measured by parameters including a safety monitoring program, physicians perception of disease activity (PPDA) and patient self-reported outcomes (PSROs). Secondary outcomes included routine blood analysis, pre-infusion serum drug concentration values and anti-drug antibody formation. <b>Results:</b> Forty eight patients treated with Remicade<sup>®</sup> were switched to Remsima<sup>®</sup> in June-July 2016 and subsequently monitored during the first 2 years. The group consisted of patients with sarcoidosis (<i>n</i> = 17), Behçet's disease (<i>n</i> = 12), non-infectious uveitis (<i>n</i> = 11), and other diagnoses (<i>n</i> = 8). There were no significant differences in PPDA, PSROs, clinical and laboratory assessments and pre-infusion serum drug concentrations between the groups. De novo anti-drug antibodies were observed in two patients. Seven patients with sarcoidosis and five with another diagnosis developed a significant disease relapse (<i>n</i> = 7) or adverse events (<i>n</i> = 5) within 2 years; 10 of these patients discontinued Remsima<sup>®</sup> treatment, one withdrew from the study and one received additional corticosteroid therapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> We observed no significant differences in PSROs, PPDA and laboratory parameters after treatment was switched from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to Remsima<sup>®</sup>. However, disease relapse or serious events were observed in 12 out of 48 patients when treatment was switched from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to Remsima<sup>®</sup>. The choice to switch anti-TNF alpha biologics in patients with rare IMIDs, particularly in sarcoidosis, requires well-considered decision-making and accurate monitoring due to a possibly higher incidence of disease worsening.

Abstract 8. Title: Observational study of inflammatory arthritis treatment by etanercept originator switched to an etanercept biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31853152
Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of switching an etanercept originator to an etanercept biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients.
In 162 patients etanercept originator treatment had been replaced with the biosimilar (Group 1), and in six patients the biosimilar was initiated as the first biological agent (Group 2). The efficacy and safety of the treatment were monitored at 3-6 months.
In the majority of patients in Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 138) the etanercept biosimilar was well tolerated, whereas in 24 patients a switch back to the originator was required. The loss of efficacy was confirmed in nine patients using clinical scoring system, and nine patients reported subjective loss of efficacy; 13 patients reported adverse events, most often headache (<i>n</i> = 3) and skin lesions (<i>n</i> = 3). In four patients injection site reactions were present. The adverse events (AE) and/or the loss of the biosimilar efficacy were more commonly observed in women, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (especially in those who did not receive methotrexate), and in patients with a previous history of any other biological treatment. In patients in Group 2 the therapy was effective and no adverse events were observed.
The etanercept biosimilar seems to be effective and well-tolerated in the majority of patients. Nevertheless, in some cases, switching from the originator to the biosimilar was associated with AEs or loss of efficacy.

Abstract 9. Title: Efficacy and tolerability of initiating, or switching to, infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): a large single-centre experience.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29687730
Abstract: Recently, the infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) received market authorisation for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), allowing cost benefits when switching to CT-P13. We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 for new and existing patients.
Treatment response, remission, primary and secondary loss of response rates, and adverse events in patients who initiated infliximab originator in the 12 months pre-switch (n = 53) were compared with the patients who initiated CT-P13 in the 12 months post-switch (n = 69). Sustained responses were compared for existing infliximab originator patients who switched to CT-P13 (n = 191) and those who continued with the originator (n = 19).
There was no difference in remission (58.1% vs. 47.4%, p = .37), response (12.6% vs. 10.5%, p = .80), secondary loss of response (24.6% vs. 42.1%, p = .10), or adverse events (4.7% vs. 0% p = 1.0) between those who switched to CT-P13 and those who continued infliximab originator. There was no difference in remission (42.0% vs. 26.4%, p = .074), response (21.7% vs. 22.6%, p = .91), primary non-response (5.8% vs. 15.1%, p = .09), secondary loss of response (21.7% vs. 22.6%, p = .91), or adverse events (8.7% vs. 11.3%, p = .63) in those who initiated CT-P13 compared with infliximab originator.
There was no difference in the efficacy and safety of infliximab originator and CT-P13 during the first 12 months after switching.

Publication Date: 2019-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30767391
Abstract: To evaluate the transition from reference infliximab Remicade to biosimilar Remsima in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
Patients were informed through a letter about the transition to a biosimilar and were subsequently contacted for possible additional questions and whether they agreed upon the transition. Once agreed, Remsima was administered at the same dosage and interval as previous treatment with Remicade. Data on the transition were analyzed in January 2018. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients continuing treatment with Remsima and secondary outcome was the change in disease activity measured with the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR). In addition, the reasons for discontinuation with infliximab or restarting Remicade were recorded.
In total 47 patients were approached, 45 patients switched from Remicade to Remsima, two patients disagreed upon transition and continued Remicade. At the end of the follow-up period of 2 years, 39 patients (87%) continued with Remsima, three patients (7%) restarted Remicade due to inefficacy according to the patient (this was not objectified by the rheumatologist) 2 (4%) patients switched to another biological due to lack of effect and in one patient (2%) infliximab was stopped because of lung malignancy. Furthermore, the DAS28-ESR remained comparable before and after the switch, with a mean (SD) of 2.34 (±1.02) and 2.31 (±1.11) respectively.
In our population, 87% of patients continued Remsima during the follow-up period of approximately 2 years. Three patients restarted Remicade, while retaining stable DAS28-ESR.

Abstract 11. Title: Switching from infliximab innovator to biosimilar in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a 12-month multicentre observational prospective cohort study.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29205444
Abstract: Infliximab biosimilars have become available for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, data showing long-term safety and effectiveness of biosimilars in IBD patients are limited.
To study prospectively the switch from infliximab innovator to biosimilar in an IBD cohort with 12 months follow-up to evaluate safety and effectiveness.
Adult IBD patients from two hospitals treated with infliximab innovator (Remicade; Janssen Biotech,  Horsham ,  Pennsylvania, USA) were switched to infliximab biosimilar (Inflectra; Hospira, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) as part of routine care, but in a controlled setting. Blood samples were taken just before the first, second, fourth and seventh infusion of biosimilar. Infliximab trough levels, antibodies-to-infliximab (ATI), CRP and ESR were measured and disease activity scores were calculated.
Our cohort consisted of 133 IBD patients (64% CD, 36% UC). Before switching we found widely varying infliximab levels (median 3.5 μg/mL). ATI were detected in eight patients (6%). Most patients were in remission or had mild disease (CD: 82% UC: 90%). After switching to biosimilar, 35 patients (26%) discontinued therapy within 12 months, mostly due to subjective higher disease activity (9%) and adverse events (AE, 9.8%). AE included general malaise/fatigue (n = 7), arthralgia (n = 2), skin problems (n = 2) and infusion reactions (n = 2). No differences in IFX levels, CRP, and disease activity scores were found between the four time points (P ≥ .0917).
We found no differences in drug levels and disease activity between infliximab innovator and biosimilar in our IBD cohort, indicating that biosimilars are safe and effective. The high proportions of discontinuers were mostly due to elective withdrawal or subjective disease worsening.

Abstract 12. Title: Multidisciplinary team intervention to reduce the nocebo effect when switching from the originator infliximab to a biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33495387
Abstract: To evaluate an intervention to reduce the nocebo effect (NE) when switching from the originator infliximab (OI) to the infliximab biosimilar SB2 in chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (CIRD).
An intervention was built with healthcare professionals (HPs) and a patient representative, based on a systematic review of interventions reducing the NE in musculoskeletal diseases and semi-directed questioning of five patients. Our strategy consisted of training HPs, switch information given by the nurses, a consistent vocabulary. All CIRD patients switched from OI to SB2 were included for the intervention. The primary outcome was the SB2 retention rate (RR) at 34 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the SB2 RR at 12 months, discontinuation rates due to a possible NE and comparison with a historical cohort of CIRD patients receiving the OI and 6 published European cohorts.
45 patients were included from March 2018 (rheumatoid arthritis, n=17, spondylarthritis, n=28). After 34 weeks, the SB2 RR was 91.2%, similar to the historical cohort RR (p=0.41) but higher than the 3 European cohort RRs (p<0.05). At 12 months, the SB2 RR was 84.5% vs 88.4% for the historical cohort (p=0.52). SB2 discontinuation due to a possible NE was 6.6% after 12 months.
A tailored communication with a prominent role of nurses reduced the NE in non-medical switches from the OI to SB2 as compared to published results. The RR was similar to the historical cohort RR. The methodology used to construct this intervention may help improve the outcomes of switches with upcoming biosimilars.

Abstract 13. Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Nonmedical Switch From Adalimumab Originator to SB5 Biosimilar in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Twelve-Month Follow-Up From the TABLET Registry.
Publication Date: 2022-Jan-05
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33570142
Abstract: Few data are currently available about SB5 in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of SB5 in a cohort of patients with IBD in stable remission switched from the adalimumab (ADA) originator and in a cohort of patients with IBD naïve to ADA.
We prospectively enrolled patients with IBD who started ADA treatment with SB5 (naïve cohort) and those who underwent a nonmedical switch from the ADA originator to SB5 (switching cohort). Clinical remission and safety were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition, in a small cohort of patients who were switched, we assessed the ADA serum trough levels and antidrug antibodies at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
In the naïve cohort, the overall remission rate at 12 months was 60.42%, whereas in the switching cohort it was 89.02%. Fifty-three (36.3%) patients experienced an adverse event, and injection site pain was the most common; it was significantly more frequent in the switching cohort (P = 0.001). No differences were found in terms of ADA serum trough levels at baseline, 3, and 6 months after switching. No patient developed antidrug antibodies after the switch.
We found that SB5 seemed effective and safe in IBD, both in the naïve cohort and in the switching cohort. Further studies are needed to confirm these data in terms of mucosal healing.

Abstract 14. Title: Outcome of Reverse Switching From CT-P13 to Originator Infliximab in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Nov-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33538298
Abstract: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and treated with originator infliximab are increasingly being switched to biosimilars. Some patients, however, are "reverse switched" to treatment with the originator. Here we assess the prevalence of reverse switching, including its indication and outcomes.
In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, data on patients with IBD from 9 hospitals in the Netherlands were collected. All adult patients with IBD were included if they previously had been switched from originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13 and had a follow-up time of at least 52 weeks after the initial switch. The reasons for reverse switching were categorized into worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, adverse effects, or loss of response to CT-P13. Drug persistence was analyzed through survival analyses.
A total of 758 patients with IBD were identified. Reverse switching was observed in 75 patients (9.9%). Patients with reverse switching were predominantly female (70.7%). Gastrointestinal symptoms (25.5%) and dermatological symptoms (21.8%) were the most commonly reported reasons for reverse switching. In 9 patients (12.0%), loss of response to CT-P13 was the reason for reverse switching. Improvement of reported symptoms was seen in 73.3% of patients after reverse switching and 7 out of 9 patients (77.8%) with loss of response regained response. Infliximab persistence was equal between patients who were reverse-switched and those who were maintained on CT-P13.
Reverse switching occurred in 9.9% of patients, predominantly for biosimilar-attributed adverse effects. Switching back to originator infliximab seems effective in patients who experience adverse effects, worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, or loss of response after switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13.

Abstract 15. Title: Switching and Discontinuation Patterns Among Patients Stable on Originator Infliximab Who Switched to an Infliximab Biosimilar or Remained on Originator Infliximab.
Publication Date: 2021-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33442230
Abstract: To compare switching and discontinuation patterns of patients stable on originator infliximab (IFX) who switched to an IFX biosimilar (switchers) or remained on originator IFX (continuers) in the United States.
Symphony Health Solutions' Patient Transactional Datasets (10/2012-03/2019) were used to identify adults with ≥2 claims for either rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and ≥1 claim for originator or biosimilar IFX. The index date was the first IFX biosimilar claim for switchers or a random originator IFX claim for continuers. All patients were required to have ≥5 originator IFX claims during the 12 months pre-index (prevalent population). The subset of patients with ≥12 months of observation prior to the first originator IFX claim was also analyzed (incident population). Switchers were matched 1:3 to continuers. Discontinuation was defined as having ≥120 days between 2 consecutive index treatment claims.
Prevalent switchers (N=1109) were 3.57-times more likely than continuers (N=3327) to switch to another originator biologic (hazard ratio [HR]=3.57, p<0.001). Of 249 prevalent switchers who switched to another originator biologic, 200 (80.3%) switched back to originator IFX. Incident switchers (N=571) were 2.55-times more likely than continuers (N=1713) to switch to another originator biologic (HR=2.55, p<0.001). Of 118 incident switchers who switched to another originator biologic, 90 (76.3%) switched back to originator IFX. Prevalent switchers were 1.25-times more likely than continuers to discontinue index therapy (HR=1.25, p<0.001). Similar results were observed in RA (prevalent population; switching: HR=3.49, p<0.001; discontinuation: HR=1.23, p=0.009) and IBD (prevalent population; switching: HR=3.82, p<0.001; discontinuation: HR=1.29, p=0.003) subgroups.
Patients switching from originator to biosimilar IFX were more likely to switch to another originator biologic (notably back to originator IFX) and discontinue index treatment than those remaining on originator IFX; however, reasons for switching are unknown.

Abstract 16. Title: Open-Label, Non-Mandatory Transitioning From Originator Etanercept to Biosimilar SB4: Six-Month Results From a Controlled Cohort Study.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29609207
Abstract: To evaluate the effects of non-mandatory transitioning from the originator biologic drug etanercept (ETN) to its biosimilar, SB4, on drug survival and effectiveness in a controlled cohort study of patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease.
In 2016, 642 patients were asked to transition their treatment from originator ETN to biosimilar SB4 by a structured communication strategy with opt-out option. Patients who consented to switch to SB4 were considered eligible for inclusion in the transition cohort, while patients being treated with originator ETN in 2014 were recruited as the historical cohort. Drug survival was compared between the 2 cohorts using Cox regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, ETN treatment duration, ETN dose interval, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug usage, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, with a robust variance estimator applied to account for repeated subjects (i.e., patients who were included in both the transition cohort and the historical cohort). Adjusted differences in the 6-month change in CRP level, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using CRP level (DAS28-CRP), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index were also assessed.
Of the 642 ETN-treated patients, 635 (99%) agreed to transition from originator ETN to biosimilar SB4, of whom 625 patients (433 with rheumatoid arthritis, 128 with psoriatic arthritis, and 64 with ankylosing spondylitis) were included in the transition cohort, and 600 ETN-treated patients from 2014 were included in the historical cohort. The crude treatment persistence rate for biosimilar SB4 over 6 months was 90% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 88-93%), compared to a 6-month treatment persistence rate of 92% (95% CI 90-94%) for originator ETN. Patients in the transition cohort, compared to the historical cohort, had a statistically significantly higher relative risk of treatment discontinuation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.36) and showed smaller decreases in the CRP level (adjusted difference 1.8, 95% CI 0.3-3.2) and DAS28-CRP (adjusted difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.25) over 6 months.
Non-mandatory transitioning from originator ETN to biosimilar SB4 using a specifically designed communication strategy resulted in a slightly lower 6-month treatment persistence rate and smaller decreases in disease activity in the transition cohort compared to the historical cohort, but these differences were not considered clinically relevant.

Abstract 17. Title: Long-term safety and efficacy of biosimilar infliximab among patients with inflammatory arthritis switched from reference product.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28331376
Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar infliximab in adult patients with inflammatory arthritis switched from reference product in our center.
In April 2014, patients attending our rheumatology service for infliximab infusions were switched from reference product to the biosimilar infliximab following consent and hospital approval.
Around 34 patients with inflammatory arthritis were switched from reference product to biosimilar infliximab in 2014: 50% female, mean age 55 years (standard deviation=12.9), mean disease duration 14.79 years (9.7), median duration on infliximab 57 months, and two-thirds on oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. There was no difference in efficacy or safety in the first 6 months of therapy. By the end of 2015, the mean follow-up on biosimilar infliximab was 15.8 (standard deviation=6.3) months. Our results showed no significant difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire score, patient global assessment of disease activity, number of disease flares, or the medication dose between the originator and the biosimilar infliximab. However, reported pain and C-reactive protein values were significantly higher during the longer follow-up period (<i>p</i>=0.043, 0.001 respectively). There was no significant difference in the number of adverse events or infusion reactions during follow-up periods. Only five (14.7%) patients discontinued the biosimilar infliximab.
Our patients experienced similar efficacy and safety for managing their arthritis with the biosimilar infliximab as the reference product infliximab, but at a much lower cost.

Abstract 18. Title: Systematic switch from innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab in inflammatory chronic diseases in daily clinical practice: The experience of Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France.
Publication Date: 2018-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29102156
Abstract: To investigate effectiveness of systematic switching treatment from innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab, and its associated factors.
In this prospective observational study, all adult patients receiving maintenance therapy with innovator infliximab in Cochin University Hospital were systematically switched to biosimilar infliximab. Effectiveness was assessed by the retention rate of biosimilar infliximab at the time of the third infusion. Sensitivity analyses for effectiveness included changes of disease activity parameters and infliximab trough levels between baseline and the last visit as well as the occurrence of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. Factors associated with biosimilar infliximab discontinuation at the last visit were explored.
A total of 260 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 31 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 131 axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and 64 inflammatory bowel diseases. The retention rate was 85% (221/260 patients) at the time of the third biosimilar infusion. Between baseline and the last visit (mean follow-up of 34 weeks), 59 patients (23%) discontinued biosimilar infliximab, mainly due to experienced inefficacy (n = 47, 80%). No clinical or biological factors were associated with biosimilar discontinuation. No serious adverse events occurred. No change in objective disease activity parameters or infliximab trough levels was detected. However, a significant increase of BASDAI (2.94 ± 2.20 vs. 3.18 ± 2.21, P = 0.046, before vs. after switch, respectively) was observed in patients with axSpA. Innovator infliximab was re-established in 47/59 patients (80%).
No changes in drug trough levels or objective parameters were observed after the systematic switch to biosimilar infliximab in a real clinical practice setting. Only changes in patient-reported outcomes were observed, suggesting attribution effects rather than pharmacological differences.

Abstract 19. Title: Doctor's aptitude for switching from innovator etanercept to biosimilar etanercept in inflammatory rheumatic diseases: experience from a single French rheumatology tertiary care center.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888052
Abstract: To describe the switch to biosimilar etanercept (bETN), evaluate factors associated with this switch, and evaluate the efficacy of this switch in a real-life setting METHODS: We included patients, from October 2016 to April 2017, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) who received innovator ETN (iETN) for at least 6 months. After receiving information on biosimilars, all physicians were invited to propose a switch from iETN to bETN. Factors associated with bETN discontinuation were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses. We estimated the proportion of patients still on bETN over time by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We assessed serum trough concentrations of iETN and bETN and anti-drug antibodies to ETN.
Overall, 183 outpatients were eligible for a potential switch; 94 (51.6%) switched from iETN to bETN. The probability of a switch was greater with an older than younger aged physician (mean [SD] age 50.4 [14.3] with a switch vs 44.8 [11.3] with no switch, p = 0.005) and the physician having a full-time academic position than other position (56.4% with a switch vs 13.5% with no switch, p < 0.001). After a 6-month follow-up, bETN retention rate was 83% (95% CI: 0.76-0.92). The first cause of bETN discontinuation was inefficacy (50%). On multivariate analysis, no factor was independently associated with a bETN switch or discontinuation. Drug trough levels did not significantly differ by discontinuation or continuation of bETN. No patient showed anti-drug antibodies.
The probability of switching from iETN to bETN was likely related to physician characteristics.

Abstract 20. Title: One-year results after transitioning from etanercept originator to biosimilar in a setting promoting shared decision-making in rheumatology.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005860
Abstract: The aim was to study the effect of non-mandatory transitioning from etanercept originator to etanercept biosimilar on retention rates in a setting promoting shared decision-making.
In 2016, all patients treated with etanercept originator and stable disease at the Rheumatology department in Bernhoven were offered transitioning to etanercept biosimilar by an opt-in approach. A historical cohort of patients treated with etanercept originator in 2015 was identified as the control group. Etanercept discontinuation was compared between the cohorts using Cox regression. To study the nocebo effect, reasons for discontinuation were categorized into objective reasons (e.g. laboratory abnormalities, increase in swollen joint count, allergic reaction) and subjective health complaints (symptoms perceptible only to the patient, e.g. tiredness, arthralgia). An adjusted Kaplan-Meier curve for retention of the etanercept biosimilar was made, censoring subjective health complaints as the reason for discontinuation.
Seventy of the 79 patients eligible for transitioning agreed to transition (89%). The 1-year crude retention rate of etanercept in the transition cohort was 73% (95% CI: 0.62, 0.83), compared with a retention rate of 89% (95% CI: 0.81, 0.95) in the historical cohort (<i>P</i> = 0.013). This resulted in a higher risk of treatment discontinuation in the transition cohort (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.73; 95% CI: 1.23, 6.05, <i>P</i> = 0.01). After adjusting for the nocebo effect, the cohorts had comparable retention rates (86 <i>vs</i> 89%, <i>P</i> = 0.51).
Non-mandatory transition from etanercept originator to its biosimilar using an opt-in approach in a setting promoting shared decision-making resulted in a higher discontinuation of etanercept compared with the historical cohort. This could be attributed largely to the nocebo effect.

Abstract 21. Title: Switching patients with inflammatory arthritis from Etanercept (Enbrel<sup>®</sup>) to the biosimilar drug, SB4 (Benepali<sup>®</sup>): A single-centre retrospective observational study in the UK and a review of the literature.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524081
Abstract: SB4 (Benepali<sup>®</sup>), the Etanercept biosimilar, is licenced in the UK for the same indications as the reference product, Enbrel<sup>®</sup>. In 2016, the Rheumatology Department at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals switched the Etanercept patients, who gave consent, to SB4. A proportion of these patients switched back to Etanercept and therefore we aimed to investigate the reasons of SB4 withdrawal and compare our results with the current evidence.
We included all the patients switched to SB4 until April 2018, identified from the departmental biologics database. We also searched the published and grey literature through November 2018 for similar articles.
72 Etanercept patients switched to SB4, of which 19 (26.4%) switched back to Etanercept within 6 months on the biosimilar product. All the 19 patients remained on Etanercept until the time of data analysis. The main reason of withdrawal was loss of effect (LOE, 58%). In RA, the duration on Etanercept was associated with SB4 withdrawal (OR 1.43 [95% CI 1.02, 2.00]) and LOE was reflected in the DAS- 28, PGS and CRP increase and in the number of tender joints (all p <0.05). We found ten observational studies reporting 3184 patients, who switched from Etanercept to SB4 and 432 of them (14%) stopped SB4.
The majority (73.6%) stayed on SB4, which is consistent with the current evidence. Taking also into consideration the results of the other studies, it is unclear if this withdrawal is a true failure on SB4, nocebo effect or spontaneous disease flare.

Abstract 22. Title: Clinical effectiveness of CT-P13 (Infliximab biosimilar) used as a switch from Remicade (infliximab) in patients with established rheumatic disease. Report of clinical experience based on prospective observational data.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26549204
Abstract: To gain clinical experience on the effectiveness and safety of switching from infliximab-Remicade(INX) to infliximab-biosimilar-CT-P13(INB) in patients with established rheumatic disease.
Patients receiving INX treatment at a rheumatology clinic consented to switching from INX to INB. Patient reported outcomes (PROs), disease-activity, and inflammatory markers were recorded at every visit. Generalized estimating equation models and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) before/during INX and INB treatments were employed.
Thirty-nine consecutive patients [mean (SD) age 53 (11), 17 F] with various rheumatic diseases were switched to INB after a mean (SD) of 4.1 (2.3) years on INX. Thirty-one patients were on concomitant methotrexate. At a median (range) of 11 (7.5-13) months following the first administration of INB, AUCs for disease activity and PROs were similar for INX and INB. They were better compared to those prior to INX. Eleven patients (28.2%) discontinued INB, due to INX antidrug antibodies detected prior to INB infusion (n = 3); latent tuberculosis (n = 1); new-onset neurofibromatosis (n = 1); subjective reasons with no objective deterioration of disease (n = 6).
The clinical effectiveness of INB in both PROs and disease-activity measures was comparable to INX during the first year of switching, with no immediate safety signals. Subjective reasons (negative expectations) may play a role among discontinuations of biosimilars. Larger patient numbers and longer follow-up are necessary for confirming this clinical experience.

Abstract 23. Title: Efficacy and safety of switching from reference adalimumab to SB5 in a real-life cohort of inflammatory rheumatic joint diseases.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514676
Abstract: SB5 showed comparable efficacy and safety profile in respect to adalimumab originator (ADA) in randomized clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of SB5 after switching from ADA in RA, axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients.
Adult RA, PsA, axSpA, JIA patients treated with ADA for at least 6 months, switched to SB5 in stable clinical conditions, were eligible. Data on safety, activity indexes and patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after switching.
Eighty-two patients (19 RA, 28 PsA, 32 axSpA and 3 JIA; 45 females, mean age 54 ± 14 years, disease duration 13 ± 7 years, ADA duration 6 ± 3 years) were enrolled. RA patients showed stable conditions, while PsA patients showed an increase in both HAQ, DAS28(CRP) and DAPSA and axSpA patients an increase in VAS pain, VAS patient disease activity and ASDAS, both at 3 months. There were changes in the concomitant medications profile, with regression of activity indexes increases at 6 months. Adverse events were reported by 33.7% patients at 3 months and 16.6% patients at 6 months, mostly disease flares and infectious events. Two patients stopped SB5.
Despite temporary changes in the concomitant medication profile for mild disease flares, our real-life data replicate the safety profile of switching from ADA to SB5 in RA, with additional data for its applicability in PsA and axSpA patients, further supporting switching to biosimilars in treating inflammatory rheumatic conditions. Key Points • Switching from adalimumab originator to SB5 is feasible in real life rheumatic inflammatory joint diseases. • Mild disease flares can present after switching from originator adalimumab to SB5, in particular in axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis. • Changes in concomitant medications profile allows the control of minor disease flares presenting after switching from adalimumab originator to SB5.

Abstract: Biosimilars used in multiple rheumatic conditions offer the -potential for cost savings. We present the outcomes of a -service evaluation of switching rheumatic patients established on originator etanercept (Enbrel) to biosimilar Benepali, using a managed switching programme funded through a novel fixed price incentivisation model.
Evaluation outcomes included savings in drug acquisition costs, patient-reported side effects, adverse events, patient outcomes and patient experience.
A total of 154 patients on Enbrel were identified for switching. A total of 113 patients (43 had rheumatoid arthritis, 43 had axial spondyloarthritis and 27 had psoriatic arthritis) were switched from originator etanercept to Benepali from August 2016 to March 2017. The Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust had the highest percentage of switches in the Thames Valley in this period. There was no increased incidence of side effects before and after switch. Drug acquisition costs were decreased by £95,000 with an overall reduction in prescribing costs of £186,000 for the local health economy.
A managed switching programme from originator etanercept to biosimilar Benepali, using a novel fixed price model, delivers significant cost savings and investment in clinical services while maintaining similar patient-reported outcomes and good patient experience.

Abstract 25. Title: A Systematic Switch From Originator Infliximab to Biosimilar Infliximab in Patients With Non-Infectious Uveitis.
Publication Date: 2021-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33121931
Abstract: To investigate the efficacy of biosimilar infliximab compared to that of the originator infliximab for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis.
Before-and-after study.
All patients in the Central Norway Health Region between 2007 and 2018 were included. They were switched from originator to biosimilar infliximab therapy from 2014 to 2017. The primary outcome was quiescence of uveitis before and after the switch. All patients were seen every 1-3 months. Visits were binned into 3-month long periods for each patient takingboth medications. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of quiescence between the 2 treatments.
Twenty-nine patients were treated with infliximab. Twenty-three of those patients were switched from originator to biosimilar infliximab. The majority were white (87%), female (92%), and had chronic anterior uveitis (65%). For patients taking the originator and biosimilar drugs, the median treatment duration was38 months (range: 8-131 months) and 15 months (range: 5-55 months), respectively. Concomitant immunosuppressive medications and topical and oral steroids were used similarly during treatment with both originator and biosimilar infliximab. The IRR for quiescence was 0.91 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.7-1.1; P = 0.38), which indicated no statistically significant differences in achieving quiescence after the switch. Also, there were no differences in the incidence rate of flare events with the switch (IRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.36-2.98; P = 0.95). IRR adjusted for intraocular surgery was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.7-1.1; P = 0.37).
No evidence of differences in effectiveness were found in comparing biosimilar to originator infliximab in patients with chronic non-infectious uveitis.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795432
Abstract: To describe the frequency of ocular flares in patients with noninfectious uveitis who were switched from the originator infliximab to a biosimilar infliximab.
Retrospective case series.
All patients with noninfectious uveitis who were switched from the originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab-abda for nonmedical reasons were reviewed. Patients were excluded if they had less than 3 months of follow-up on either drug. Data included patient demographics, infliximab dosage information, additional immunosuppression medications, and numbers of and times to flares. The main study outcome was frequency of flares, defined as new or worsening inflammatory activity on examination or imaging.
A total of 17 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were no statistical differences between the duration of follow-up while on the originator and the duration while on the biosimilar infliximab (12.0 vs. 10.1 months, respectively; P = .307). Patients experienced more flares per person-years after switching to infliximab-abda (.92), than on the originator infliximab (0.19; P = .028). Four of the 6 patients (66.7%) who experienced flare after switching to infliximab-abda did so within 90 days. Only 1 patient had flares while on originator infliximab went on to develop a single flare on infliximab-abda. The final normalized dosage for patients who flared and remained on infliximab-abda (1.301 mg/kg/week) was higher than that for those who did not flare (1.186 mg/kg/week) but was not statistically significant (P = .417).
Patients who were switched to biosimilar infliximab-abda experience more flares than when previously treated with the originator infliximab. Providers should closely observe patients who switch to biosimilar infliximab, especially within the first 90 days. Patients who do have flares after switching may achieve quiescence with increased biosimilar dosage.

Abstract 27. Title: Effects of successive switches to different biosimilars infliximab on immunogenicity in chronic inflammatory diseases in daily clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268935
Abstract: To evaluatre the risk of immunogenicity in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases who experienced successive non-medical swiches to different biosimilars infliximab.
Observational study over a 3-year observation period assessing the risk of immunogenicity in i) patients in maintenance therapy with innovator infliximab who were successively switched to CT-P13, then to SB2 (cohort-1) and ii) biologic-naive patients initiated with CT-P13 before being switched to SB2 (cohort-2). A propotion meta-analysis was also performed, integrating our results to 16 additional studies.
Cohort-1 included 265 patients who switched to CT-P13, and 140 patients were subsequently switched to SB2. Among the 235 anti-drug antibody (ADA)-free patients at baseline, 20 patients (8.5%) developed ADA over the 3-year observation period (rate of 3 for 100 patient years). Cohort-2 included 44 patients, of whom 29 subsequently switched to SB2. A total of 11 patients (25%) developed ADA within 3 years (rate of 14 for 100 patients years). We found no influence of the number of biosimilars infliximab received on ADA deveopment in both cohorts. The risk of treatment discontinuation was significantly higher in patients with positive ADA in both cohorts. The meta-analysis including our data exposed an incidence of immunogenicity of 4.7% (95% CI 3.5-6.1%) after the switch from innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab and 21.1% (95% CI 13.1-30.3%) in patients initiating biosimilar infliximab.
Immunogenicity was not favored by successive non-medical switches to biosimilars infliximab in our study, but was associated with treatment discontinuation.

Abstract 28. Title: Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 in real-life: The weight of patient acceptance.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29154920
Abstract: To explore acceptance and retention rate of biosimilar CT-P13 after switching from originator infliximab (OI) in patients with various rheumatic diseases.
Patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) under OI were proposed to switch to CT-P13 at the same regimen. A prospective cohort of infliximab-naïve patients beginning CT-P13 and a retrospective cohort of patients treated with OI were used as controls. The primary outcome was to evaluate the retention rate of CT-P13. Secondary outcomes were the switch acceptance rate, reasons of failure and safety.
Switch was proposed to 100 patients and accepted by 89 of them (63 AS, 12 PsA and 14 RA). After a median follow-up of 33 weeks, 72% of patients were still treated with CT-P13. This retention rate was significantly lower than the one found in our retrospective and prospective control cohorts: 88% and 90% respectively (P-value=0.0002). Within patients who asked to be reswitched to OI, 13/25 (52%) presented clinical disease activity, one developed serum sickness and 11 (44%) presented no objective activity. A subanalysis excluding these 11 patients abrogated difference in retention rates between the 3 cohorts (P-value=0.453). After reswitching to OI, patients without objective disease activity claimed to recover original efficacy.
Retention rate was lower after switching from OI to CT-P13 compared to our control cohorts. However, this difference faded after excluding patients without objective clinical activity, suggesting a reluctance of patients to the switch and a negative perception of the biosimilar.

Abstract 29. Title: Subjective Complaints as the Main Reason for Biosimilar Discontinuation After Open-Label Transition From Reference Infliximab to Biosimilar Infliximab.
Publication Date: 2018-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29045077
Abstract: To evaluate drug survival, effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety in daily practice after transitioning treatment from original reference infliximab (Remicade [REM]) to a biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13 [Remsima; Inflectra]) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis.
Of the initial 222 REM-treated patients, 192 agreed to transition to CT-P13 and were included in this multicenter prospective cohort study. Changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and changes in the CRP levels, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibody levels were assessed after 6 months, and adverse events (AEs) were documented. Drug survival and prognostic factors were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
During 6 months follow-up, 24% of the patients (n = 47) discontinued CT-P13. Thirty-seven patients restarted REM, 7 switched to another biologic drug, and 3 continued without a biologic drug. The DAS28-CRP remained stable from baseline to month 6, with a mean ± SD score of 2.2 ± 0.9 at baseline to 2.2 ± 0.8 at 6 months (difference of 0.0 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.1, 0.2]). The BASDAI increased from a mean ± SD of 3.8 ± 2.0 at baseline to 4.3 ± 2.1 at 6 months (difference of +0.5 [95% CI 0.1, 0.9]). The CRP levels, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibody levels did not change. Just prior to CT-P13 discontinuation, the DAS28-CRP components tender joint count and patient's global assessment of disease activity, as well as the BASDAI were increased compared to baseline. The most frequently reported AEs were arthralgia, fatigue, pruritus, and myalgia. A shorter REM infusion interval (hazard ratio: 0.77 [95% CI 0.62, 0.95]) at baseline was predictive of discontinuing CT-P13.
In our cohort, one-fourth of patients discontinued CT-P13 during 6 months of follow-up, mainly due to an increase in the subjective features of the tender joint count and the patient's global assessment of disease activity and/or subjective AEs, possibly explained by nocebo effects and/or incorrect causal attribution effects.

Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30498332
Abstract: This study compared treatment patterns of Turkish patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were treated with innovator Remicade<sup>®</sup> (infliximab [IFX]) and either continued IFX or switched to CT-P13.
Adult RA patients with ≥1 IFX claim were identified from the Turkish Ministry of Health database. Eligible patients initiated and continued IFX treatment (continuers cohort [CC]) or initiated IFX and switched to CT-P13 (switchers cohort [SC]) during the study period. The initial IFX claim date was defined as the index date. The switch/reference date was defined as the CT-P13 switch date for the SC or a random IFX date during the period of CT-P13 availability for the CC. Cohorts were matched by age, sex, and number of IFX prescriptions during baseline. Patient demographics, discontinuation, and switching were summarized. The baseline period was defined as the period from the index date to the switch/reference date. The follow-up period ranged from the switch/reference date to the end of data availability.
After matching, 697 patients were selected: 605 patients for the CC and 92 patients for the SC. Mean IFX duration for the baseline period was 422 days in the CC and 438 days in the SC. Median time on any infused tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapy was 1,080 days in the CC and 540 days in the SC during the study period. During the follow-up period, discontinuation was lower in the CC (CC=33.9% vs SC=87.5%; <i>P</i><0.001). The mean time to discontinuation was longer in the CC (CC=276 days vs SC=132 days; <i>P</i><0.001). A switch to another biologic medication during the follow-up period was observed in 19.0% of patients in the CC (n=115) and 81.5% of patients in the SC (n=75; <i>P</i><0.001).
Treatment patterns differed between patients prescribed IFX and CT-P13. In Turkey, RA patients maintained on IFX had greater treatment persistence (ie, fewer and later discontinuations) than those who initiated IFX and switched to CT-P13.

Abstract 31. Title: Short article: Switching to a infliximab biosimilar: short-term results of clinical monitoring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29538037
Abstract: Currently, a biosimilar of Remicade is available (CT-P13). Switching patients from Remicade to a biosimilar is still under debate, especially for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a retrospective study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of switching patients with IBD from Remicade to a biosimilar infliximab.
At two large general hospitals in The Netherlands, adult patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis being treated with Remicade were asked to switch to the biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13). After switching, patients were closely monitored by assessing disease activity and evaluating disease-specific measures (serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin). Adverse effects were recorded and serum infliximab concentrations measured. All parameters were assessed at baseline (t=0) and after two infusions with biosimilar infliximab (±week 16).
Among 197 patients with IBD switched to the biosimilar infliximab (∼77%), and no difference in disease activity was observed. Disease-specific measures did not differ between baseline and after two infusions with the biosimilar. Apart from one infusion-related reaction, no serious or unexpected adverse reactions were reported. Serum trough concentrations did not differ between baseline and after switching [median: 4.1 µg/ml (range: 0.03-22 µg/ml) vs. 4.6 µg/ml (range: 0.03-22 µg/ml); P=0.08, n=98].
These data suggest that switching patients with IBD to the biosimilar infliximab is safe in clinical practice. After the switch, no clinically relevant differences were observed in disease activity, adverse effects, and serum infliximab concentrations.

Abstract 32. Title: The nocebo effect challenges the non-medical infliximab switch in practice.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29368188
Abstract: In clinical practice, non-medical switching of biological medication may provoke nocebo effects due to unexplained deterioration of therapeutic benefits. Indication extrapolation, idiosyncratic reactions, and interchangeability remain challenged in clinical practice after biosimilar approval by the European Medicines Agency. The principle of "first do no harm" may be challenged in a patient when switching from originator to biosimilar biological.
To describe the 1-year results of a pragmatic study on infliximab biosimilar implementation in immune-mediated inflammatory disease patients on the basis of shared decision-making under effectiveness and safety monitoring.
Inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatology patients on infliximab originator were converted to infliximab biosimilar after providing informed consent. Nocebo response patients were monitored after switch back to originator. Linear mixed models were used to analyze continuous endpoints on effectiveness and laboratory outcomes to determine significance (P ≤ 0.05) of change over time after switching.
After inviting 146 patients, a group of 125 patients enrolled in the project over time, respectively, 73 Crohn's disease, 28 ulcerative colitis, nine rheumatoid arthritis, ten psoriatic arthritis, and five ankylosing spondylitis patients. No statistically significant changes in effectiveness and safety were observed in any of the indications after a median of 4 infusions in 9 months of study. An overall nocebo response of 12.8% was found among the patients during a minimal observation period of 6 months after the transition to biosimilar infliximab. The overall nocebo response rate did not differ between the studied indications.
In inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatological patients, similar effectiveness and safety were demonstrated on the transition into infliximab biosimilar. In our series, patient empowerment and registration of treatment outcomes delineated biosimilar transition, an approach that hypothetically could reduce nocebo response rates which are relevant to account for regarding biosimilar implementation.

Abstract 33. Title: Brief Report: Safety and Immunogenicity of Rituximab Biosimilar GP 2013 After Switch From Reference Rituximab in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30295429
Abstract: Comparable clinical efficacy of the rituximab (RTX) biosimilar GP2013 and reference RTX has been established in blinded randomized trials. However, when switching from a reference biologic to a biosimilar, potential safety implications are often an important consideration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of switching from reference RTX to RTX biosimilar GP2013 compared with treatment continuation with reference RTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group safety study, 107 patients with RA who had previously received treatment (of any duration) with reference RTX as part of routine practice and who required continuation of treatment were randomized to receive either GP2013 or to continue treatment with reference RTX. All patients received a stable dosage of methotrexate and folic acid during the study. Study assessments included the incidence of hypersensitivity, infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, immunogenicity (antidrug antibodies), and general safety.
Regardless of whether patients switched to GP2013 or continued treatment with reference RTX, the incidences of hypersensitivity (9.4% and 11.1%, respectively) and infusion-related reactions (11.3% and 18.5%, respectively) were similarly low. Only 1 patient (in the reference RTX group) developed antidrug antibodies to RTX after starting study treatment. No neutralizing antidrug antibodies were observed. Antidrug antibodies were not associated with adverse events (AEs). No clinically meaningful differences in the rate of AEs were observed between treatment groups.
No safety risks were detected when patients switched from reference RTX to GP2013. The safety profiles of patients in both treatment groups were similar, although the study was not powered for statistical testing of equivalence in safety.

Abstract 34. Title: Serum concentrations after switching from originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13 in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (SECURE): an open-label, multicentre, phase 4 non-inferiority trial.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29606564
Abstract: Biological treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases has improved patient outcomes but increased health-care costs. Switching patients from originator infliximab to a biosimilar can reduce costs, but prospective data about pharmacokinetics and potential immunogenicity are scarce. We aimed to show that infliximab serum concentrations with biosimilar CT-P13 are non-inferior to those with originator infliximab after switching from originator infliximab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
SECURE was a prospective, open-label, interventional, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4 trial at 13 academic and non-academic sites in Belgium and the Netherlands. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, were in clinical remission, and were on continuous treatment with originator infliximab for more than 30 weeks. Patients were switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13 at a dose and infusion duration identical to those of originator infliximab (ie, ∼5 mg/kg every 7-9 weeks). Patients were followed up for 16 weeks after switching, with serum concentrations of infliximab measured at baseline (before the first dose of CT-P13), 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was serum concentrations of infliximab 16 weeks after switching, assessed separately in patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease in the per-protocol population, which included all patients with available serum concentrations and without major protocol violations. A non-inferiority margin of 15% was set (the null hypothesis was that the geometric mean of the ratio of serum infliximab concentrations at 16 weeks to those at baseline was 85% or less). Safety analyses were done in the safety population, which included participants who received at least one dose of CT-P13 and attended at least one safety assessment after that dose. This trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrialsRegister.eu, number 2014-004904-31, and is completed.
Between June 5, 2015, and April 6, 2016, 120 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease were recruited: 59 with ulcerative colitis and 61 with Crohn's disease. 46 patients with ulcerative colitis and 42 patients with Crohn's disease comprised the per-protocol population. The geometric mean ratio of serum infliximab concentrations at week 16 (CT-P13) compared with those at baseline (originator) was 110·1% (90% CI 96·0-126·3) in patients with ulcerative colitis and 107·6% (97·4-118·8) in those with Crohn's disease. In both cases, the lower bound of the 90% CI was higher than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 85%. Six serious adverse events were reported in six patients. Only one of these adverse events, a perianal abscess, was judged to be related to study treatment.
Switching to CT-P13 is safe and well tolerated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission. Future trials should assess switching to CT-P13 in patients with active disease.

Abstract 35. Title: Similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of adalimumab biosimilar BI 695501 and Humira reference product in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis: results from the phase III randomised VOLTAIRE-RA equivalence study.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514803
Abstract: To demonstrate clinical equivalence of adalimumab biosimilar candidate BI 695501 with Humira.
Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis on stable methotrexate were randomised to BI 695501 or Humira in a double-blind, parallel-group, equivalence study. At week 24, patients were rerandomised to continue BI 695501 or Humira, or switch from Humira to BI 695501. The coprimary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) at weeks 12 and 24. Further efficacy and safety endpoints and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 58.
645 patients were randomised. At week 12, 67.0% and 61.1% (90% CI -0.9 to 12.7) of patients receiving BI 695501 (n=324) and Humira (n=321), respectively, achieved ACR20; at week 24 the corresponding values were 69.0% and 64.5% (95% CI -3.4 to 12.5). These differences were within prespecified margins (week 12: 90% CI (-12% to 15%); week 24: 95% CI (-15% to 15%)), demonstrating therapeutic bioequivalence. 593 patients were rerandomised at week 24. Up to week 48, mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates were similar across the switched (n=147), continuous BI 695501 (n=298) and continuous Humira (n=148) groups. Similar immunogenicity (antidrug antibodies (ADAs), ADA titres and neutralising antibodies) was seen between BI 695501 and Humira (to week 24) and across rerandomised groups (to week 48). Safety and tolerability profiles were similar between groups.
BI 695501 demonstrated similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to Humira; switch from Humira to BI 695501 had no impact on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.

Abstract 36. Title: Treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving biosimilar filgrastim for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced/febrile neutropaenia: Results from the MONITOR-GCSF study.
Publication Date: 2019-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968997
Abstract: Real-world evidence data on the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are limited. MONITOR-GCSF is a pan-European, multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study designed to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients receiving biosimilar filgrastim in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropaenia (CIN) and febrile neutropaenia (FN).
In this subanalysis, patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes are described for 345 patients with stage 3 or 4 NSCLC, receiving up to six chemotherapy cycles. Patients were treated with biosimilar filgrastim as per their treating physician's best judgement.
CIN (any grade) occurred in 13.6% of patients in Cycle 1 and in 36.5% of patients in all cycles. FN occurred in 1.4% of patients in Cycle 1 and in 5.2% of patients in all cycles. Grade 3-4 FN occurred in 1.2% of patients in Cycle 1 and in 3.8% of patients in all cycles.
Results show that in real-life practice in patients with NSCLC, biosimilar filgrastim has similar effectiveness and safety to the known effectiveness and safety profile of reference filgrastim, supporting the use of biosimilar filgrastim for the real-world treatment of neutropaenia in patients with NSCLC.

Abstract 37. Title: Phosphorylation of intracellular signalling molecules in peripheral blood cells from patients with psoriasis on originator or biosimilar infliximab.
Publication Date: 2018-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29274242
Abstract: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by a dysregulated immune response and it is associated with substantial systemic comorbidities. Biological drugs such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors can ameliorate the disease but are expensive. Biosimilar drugs have the same amino-acid sequence as the originator, but differences in manufacturing can affect biological activity, efficacy and tolerability.
To explore potential differences in intracellular phosphorylation of signalling molecules in peripheral blood cells from patients with psoriasis treated with the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab compared with healthy controls, and to investigate if the phosphorylation pattern was influenced by switching from the originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13.
By flow cytometry, we measured phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, before and after TNF-α stimulation in monocytes and T, B, natural killer and CD3<sup>+</sup>  CD56<sup>+</sup> cells from 25 patients with psoriasis treated with infliximab and 19 healthy controls.
At inclusion, phosphorylation levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were increased in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls, even though clinical remission had already been achieved. Phosphorylation levels declined in patients on both originator infliximab and biosimilar during continued treatment. No significant differences were detected between the two medications after 12 months.
Patients with psoriasis on infliximab have higher activation levels of PBMCs than do healthy controls, possibly reflecting systemic inflammation. Switching from the originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 did not affect phosphorylation levels or clinical parameters, suggesting that CT-P13 is a noninferior treatment alternative to the originator infliximab.

Abstract 38. Title: A survey of pharmacists' knowledge and views of biosimilars in Quebec and France.
Publication Date: 2017-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28237527
Abstract: The objective of this study was to survey pharmacists' knowledge and views of biosimilars in Quebec and France.
An online and anonymous survey was conducted. The survey was divided into two parts including: (1) ten multiple choice questions on main characteristics that distinguish biosimilars from generic drugs; (2) fifteen statements on biosimilars key issues (interchangeability, immunogenicity risk management…). Pharmacists were asked to indicate their level of agreement to these statements using a 5-item Likert scale. A descriptive statistical analysis of the results was performed.
A total of 229 pharmacists answered the survey (141 in Quebec and 88 in France). Pharmacists know the main differences between generic drugs and biosimilars. Viewpoints of pharmacists on biosimilars key issues are alike: nomenclature of biosimilars is essential to avoid confusions with the reference drug; the creation of a list of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic drugs is necessary; responsibilities for immunogenicity risk management should be shared between pharmacists and physicians. However, viewpoints vary regarding the patient informed consent for biologic drugs substitution.
Knowledge and views of pharmacists about biosimilars in Quebec and in France are alike. Pharmacists should be knowledgeable about the particularities and key issues of biosimilars because they will play a key role for their introduction in clinical practice. They should be aware of the evolution of the legal framework of biosimilars to ensure their safe and optimal use.

Abstract 39. Title: The Automatic Substitution of Biosimilars: Definitions of Interchangeability are not Interchangeable.
Publication Date: 2021-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33745111
Abstract: In the USA, an interchangeability designation provides biosimilar sponsors with a pathway for achieving what is standard for small-molecule generics: pharmacy-level auto-substitution for an innovator. No other major health authority links interchangeability to automatic substitution, as all require the involvement of the prescriber or patient in a medication change. This editorial considers the clinical impact and practicality of auto-substitution. First, interchangeability is linked to non-medical switching (NMS), the practice of switching treatment in patients with stable disease for non-clinical reasons. NMS may generate negative sentiment in those unwilling or reluctant to switch, which can adversely impact treatment outcomes (i.e., nocebo effect). Indeed, in real-world studies of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, discontinuation rates have been shown to be higher in patients switched to biosimilars for non-medical reasons than in historical cohorts maintained on innovators. Second, interchangeability may impede pharmacovigilance and traceability, as not all jurisdictions require innovators and biosimilars to have distinct biologic names. Third, an interchangeability designation from the US Food and Drug Administration only permits a biosimilar to be automatically substituted for its innovator, not other biosimilars (if available). Pharmacist education would be needed to avoid off-label, automatic substitution among biosimilars of a single innovator. Last, once granted, an interchangeability designation exists in perpetuity under current US federal law. However, the supply chains of innovators and biosimilars are maintained independently, with no requirement for reconfirmation of biosimilarity or interchangeability. We feel that additional guidance is needed for the auto-substitution of biosimilars and innovators to become a reality.

Abstract: PF-06438179/GP1111 (Zessly<sup>®</sup>; Ixifi<sup>®</sup>) [hereafter referred to as GP1111] is a biosimilar of the reference monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody infliximab, and is approved in the EU and USA for the same indications as the reference drug, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (including paediatric ulcerative colitis in the EU), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis; GP1111 is also approved in Japan. GP1111 has similar physicochemical characteristics and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference infliximab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of the agents has been shown in healthy volunteers and patients with moderate-to-severe RA despite methotrexate therapy. GP1111 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference infliximab in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, despite methotrexate therapy, and was generally well tolerated in this population. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of GP1111 were similar to those of reference infliximab, and switching from reference infliximab to GP1111 had no impact on safety, efficacy or immunogenicity. The role of reference infliximab in the management of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is well established and GP1111 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring infliximab therapy.

Abstract 42. Title: Patients' Understanding and Attitudes Towards Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars: Result of a UK Web-Based Survey.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28752242
Abstract: Infliximab and etanercept biosimilars present significant potential cost savings to the NHS. Patients need to be involved in the decision to use these medicines but there is limited published literature on their knowledge and attitudes about these biosimilars.
The aim of this study was to investigate ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis patients' knowledge and attitudes towards infliximab and etanercept biosimilars in the UK.
A self-administered web survey was conducted among the members of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society in the UK between 2 March 2017 and 2 June 2017.
A total of 182 patients participated in this survey. The majority of participants (73%) were on etanercept, and 66 and 80% of patients on originator biologic and biosimilars, respectively, understood what biosimilars were. Patients who were currently on biosimilars had greater confidence in their effectiveness and the doctor's decision to initiate than those who were originally on originator biologics that doctors proposed to switch to biosimilars. The majority (82%) of participants on biosimilars thought that biosimilars help to save money for the NHS, while just over half (54%) of participants on the originator biologics thought the cost of treatment should not be considered when prescribing biosimilars.
Survey participants had a good knowledge and understanding of biosimilars. Participants on biosimilars were confident and positive about biosimilars' safety, efficacy and switching, whereas participants on the originator biologics were more reluctant to switch to biosimilars. Those patients who expressed concerns felt that more clinical trials on switching biosimilars, better communication and reassurance by healthcare professional teams and further involvement in decision making would increase their acceptance of biosimilars.

Abstract: To investigate UK healthcare professionals' perceptions and perspectives towards biosimilar infliximab, etanercept and insulin glargine and the potential barriers and facilitators to their prescribing.
A cross-sectional qualitative study design was used.
Five hospitals within the West Midlands area in UK.
30 min face-to-face, semistructured interviews of healthcare professionals.
22 healthcare professionals (consultants, nurses and pharmacists) participated in the semistructured interviews.
Participants' opinion and attitudes about biosimilars and the barriers and facilitators to the prescribing of infliximab, etanercept and insulin glargine biosimilars in gastroenterology, rheumatology and diabetology specialties.
This study showed that UK healthcare professionals had good knowledge of biosimilars and were content to initiate them. Healthcare professionals disagreed with biosimilar auto-substitution at pharmacy level and multiple switching. Subtle differences among healthcare professionals were identified in the acceptance of switching stable patients, indication extrapolation and cost savings sharing.
Safety and efficacy concerns, patients' opinion and how cost savings were shared were the identified barriers to considering prescribing biosimilars. Real-life data and financial incentives were the suggested facilitators to increase biosimilar utilisation.

Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31401899
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: CT-P13 was developed as an infliximab biosimilar in 2013. The primary structure of CT-P13 is identical to that of original infliximab and it has highly similar higher order structure, physiochemical characteristics, and biological properties. To date, data from real-life cohorts and randomized controlled trials show comparable clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of biosimilar CT-P13, and the original reference medicinal Product (RMP). <b>Areas covered</b>: This article reviews the comparability of CT-P13 and the RMP and focuses on the emerging clinical trial and observational cohorts data on efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The development of a subcutaneous formulation of Infliximab CT-P13 is also addressed. <b>Expert opinion</b>: There is a plethora of evidence to show CT-P13 is non-inferior to infliximab RMP in IBD and that a switch from RMP to this biosimilar is feasible and safe. However, interchangeability and multiple switches can still not be endorsed for introduction into clinical practice.

Abstract 46. Title: Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Ustekinumab, Infliximab, or Adalimumab for the Treatment of Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease in Biologic-Naïve Patients.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30565265
Abstract: Ustekinumab was recently approved by the United States U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In this analysis, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab, infliximab, or adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-severe Crohn's disease in patients who failed conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and immunomodulators) but were naïve to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (i.e., biologic drugs).
Cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model structure (decision tree and Markov model).
A decision tree simulated biologic induction, and a Markov model simulated biologic and conventional therapy maintenance. Cycle length was 2 weeks with a discounted 5-year time horizon and a limited U.S. societal perspective in the base case; results from a payer perspective are also reported. Transition probabilities, direct costs, indirect costs, and utilities were obtained from the literature. To measure relative treatment value (i.e., order of treatment cost-effectiveness), net monetary benefits were reported for a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case. Infliximab dominated both adalimumab and ustekinumab, with a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $9943 and $29,798, respectively, in the base case. Adalimumab dominated ustekinumab, with an NMB of $19,855. All biologics yielded similar quality-adjusted life-years (~3.5), whereas costs varied substantially ($50,510, $54,985, and $72,921 for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, respectively). The payer perspective, alternate time horizons, and scenario analyses consistently showed infliximab dominance. One-way, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results with respect to all parameters. Although biosimilars were not explicitly modeled as comparators, one-way sensitivity analysis showed that drug acquisition costs could alter relative treatment value but would have to be varied by at least 50%.
For moderate-severe Crohn's disease, infliximab yields significantly more NMBs compared with both adalimumab and ustekinumab. Additional clinical (e.g., empiric dosing, biologic cycling) and quality-of-life (e.g., lost productivity, disutility of home injections) research is needed to allow for model frameworks and parameters that more accurately reflect the nuances of Crohn's disease treatment.

Abstract 47. Title: Budget Impact Analysis of Switching to Rituximab's Biosimilar in Rheumatology and Cancer in 13 Countries Within the Middle East and North Africa.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32982342
Abstract: Biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies are being rapidly developed and approved by public health regulatory authorities worldwide. These biosimilars are expected to bring significant budgetary savings to national governments and consequently increase patients' accessibility to biological therapy. Rituximab has been used extensively for the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid disorders over the past two decades. New biosimilars of Rituximab have been developed and introduced into clinical practice. We have analyzed the budgetary impact and savings outcome of introducing Rituximab's biosimilar into 13 countries within the Middle East and North Africa through the implementation of a budget impact analysis model.
Our model was based on a 1-year full uptake and switch scenario of the Rituximab's biosimilar CT-P10. The model calculated the total number of patients based on the total national consumption of Rituximab per country. Accordingly, the model produced savings per each indication which were translated into the additional number of patients that would be permitted access to Rituximab's therapy as a result of these savings.
In our modeling scenario, the total projected savings that will result from the uptake of Rituximab's biosimilar within the MENA region were estimated to be 46.59 million dollars. The cumulative savings in all 13 countries would allow access of Rituximab's therapy for a total of 6589 patients which is equivalent to a 14% increase in the number of patients benefiting from Rituximab's therapy.
The introduction of Rituximab's biosimilar within the Middle East and North Africa region is associated with significant budgetary savings that will allow public national health authorities to reinvest such economic gains either in expanding access to Rituximab therapy or other costly lifesaving biologicals.

Abstract 48. Title: Biosimilar uptake by British local formularies: a cross sectional study.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28871421
Abstract: Background Biological medicines are starting to lose their patent protection, so similar, inexact copies (biosimilars) are being developed and licensed. The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of the first wave of biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local formularies (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local formularies in GB. Method In November 2014, local formularies (medicines formularies of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local formularies were screened. Amongst the 80% of formularies in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49% of local formularies for filgrastim, 11% for somatropin and in only 6% for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic market, their uptake measured using local British formularies was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics. Finally, geographical variability within GB requires further investigation.

Abstract 49. Title: Randomised, double-blind, phase III study comparing the infliximab biosimilar, PF-06438179/GP1111, with reference infliximab: efficacy, safety and immunogenicity from week 30 to week 54.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30997153
Abstract: To investigate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PF-06438179/GP1111 (PF-SZ-IFX) compared with European reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>; ref-IFX) in patients with moderate-to-severe, active rheumatoid arthritis after continued long-term use of PF-SZ-IFX, and in patients who were switched from ref-IFX to PF-SZ-IFX.
REFLECTIONS B537-02 was a double-blind, active-controlled, multinational study in which patients (N=650) were initially randomised to PF-SZ-IFX or ref-IFX for 30 weeks (treatment period [TP] 1). During weeks 30-54 (TP2), the PF-SZ-IFX group (n=280) continued treatment with PF-SZ-IFX (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) and patients in the ref-IFX group (n=286) were rerandomised (1:1) to continue ref-IFX (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) (n=143) or switch to PF-SZ-IFX (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) (n=143) for a further 24 weeks. Efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics were evaluated.
During TP2, patients in all three treatment groups continued to maintain comparable treatment response. At week 54, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response rates were 71.1% (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX), 64.3% (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) and 70.6% (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX). Observations for other endpoints, including ACR50/70, Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints Based on High-Sensitivity C Reactive Protein(DAS28-CRP) remission, and mean change in DAS28-CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, were also comparable. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 36.8% (PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX), 33.6% (ref-IFX/ref-IFX) and 37.8% (ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX) of patients; there were no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profiles between groups. The percentage of patients who were antidrug antibody-positive was generally stable through the treatment period and comparable overall between the PF-SZ-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX (52.1%; neutralising: 80.8%), ref-IFX/ref-IFX (60.1%; neutralising: 84.9%) and ref-IFX/PF-SZ-IFX (58.0%; neutralising 78.3%) groups.
The similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PF-SZ-IFX compared with ref-IFX were maintained for up to 54 weeks and were not affected by blinded treatment switch from ref-IFX to PF-SZ-IFX at week 30.

Abstract 50. Title: Immunogenicity of an adalimumab biosimilar, FKB327, and its reference product in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32852139
Abstract: This study, FKB327-003, is a phase 3, open-label extension (OLE) study comparing the long-term immunogenicity of an adalimumab biosimilar, FKB327 (F), with the reference product (RP).
In the OLE, patients completing 24 weeks of an initial randomized, double-blind (DB) study (Period 1) with clinical response and no safety concerns were rerandomized to F or RP, so that two-thirds of patients remained on the same treatment and one-third switched to the alternate treatment for weeks 24 through 54 (OLE weeks 0-30; Period 2), then all received F through week 100 (OLE week 76; Period 3). Treatment sequences were F-F-F (no switch), RP-F-F and RP-RP-F (single switch), and F-RP-F (double switch). Patients who entered the OLE study were evaluated for immunogenicity across switching sequences.
The proportion of patients with positive antidrug antibody (ADA) status at the end of Period 1 was 61.7% and 60.0% for F and RP, respectively. The proportion of patients with positive ADA status did not increase throughout Period 1, and was similar for F and RP at all time points. At the end of Period 3, the proportion of patients with positive ADA status was lower in all treatment sequences, at 51.1%, 54.4%, 48.1%, and 42.5% for F-F-F, F-RP-F, RP-F-F, and RP-RP-F, respectively.
The RP and F showed comparable immunogenicity characteristics after long-term administration. Development of ADAs with the RP and F was similar, and was not impacted by switching and double switching between F and RP treatment.

Abstract 51. Title: Interchangeability of Biosimilars: What Level of Clinical Evidence is Needed to Support the Interchangeability Designation in the United States?
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32990892
Abstract: A biosimilar is a biologic drug that is "highly similar to a reference (originator) product, with no clinically meaningful differences between the two products in safety, purity, and potency". Regulatory approval of a biosimilar is based on analytical, structural, and functional comparisons with the reference product, comparative nonclinical (in vivo) studies, clinical pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity. In addition, comparative clinical efficacy and safety assessments are usually conducted and, taken together, comprise the "totality of the evidence" supporting biosimilarity. For a biosimilar to meet the additional designation of interchangeability in the United States (US), the applicant must demonstrate that the biological drug can be expected to produce the "same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient" and "if the biological drug is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological drug and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch". The challenges faced in conducting clinical studies to support a designation of interchangeability, as defined in the final interchangeability guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration, are considered. Potential alternative approaches to generating adequate and sufficient clinical data to support a designation of interchangeability are also presented.

Abstract 52. Title: Clinical guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease: Update of a French national consensus.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33160886
Abstract: New treatments and therapeutic approaches repeatedly emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease.
to update the French treatment algorithms for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
A formal consensus method was used to determine changes to the treatment algorithms for various situations of CD and UC. Thirty-seven experts voted on questions that had been drafted by the steering committee ahead of time. Consensus was defined as at least 66% of experts agreeing on a response.
Anti-TNF were reinforced as a first-line therapy rather than the use of immunosuppressant alone. Vedolizumab for UC, ustekinumab for CD took place as second-line maintenance therapy and potentially as a first-line therapy in the setting of unrestricted reimbursement for vedolizumab. Tofacitinib was recommended by the experts in case of vedolizumab failure for UC. Algorithms for complicated CD with abscess, intestinal and complex anal fistula were updated according to recent prospective cohort studies.
The changes incorporated to the algorithms provide up-to-date and easy-to-use guidelines to treat patients with IBD.

Abstract 53. Title: Biosimilars and Novel Insulins.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31764128
Abstract: Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes and may be necessary in type 2 diabetes. Current insulin analogues present a more physiological profile, are effective, and with less risk of hypoglycemia, but they are expensive. Biosimilar insulins should offer the advantages of insulin analogues at reduced costs. In addition, current rapid-acting insulin analogues are not fast enough to control excessive postprandial glucose excursions in many patients.
Biosimilar insulins demonstrated that are safe and effective, but interchangeability and automatic substitution remain an issue. Ultrafast-acting insulins should reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and improve flexibility in insulin dosing.
This systematic review was conducted following widely recommended methods. We searched for each topic in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and SCISEARCH for relevant citations for the appropriate period.
LY2963016 and MK-1293 are biosimilar insulins of insulin glargine, and SAR342434 is a biosimilar of insulin lispro. The abbreviated developed program demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety and supports their use for treatment of people with diabetes but no interchangeability. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a new formulation of insulin aspart with accelerated subcutaneous absorption. Faster aspart demonstrated noninferiority in reducing HbA1c as compared to insulin aspart with superiority in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing hypoglycemia, and flexible insulin dosing.
Biosimilar insulins have comparable PK-PD profiles and equivalent efficacy and safety to original insulins at a lower price, making them available for more people with diabetes. Faster aspart is the first ultrafast-acting insulin. New upcoming clinical trials and more clinical experience with faster aspart will show the real potential of this new insulin.

Abstract 54. Title: Biosimilars in rheumatology.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568820
Abstract: Biotechnologicals are an invaluable resource in the treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) non-responsive or intolerant to conventional therapies. However, they are the main driver for increase in direct costs and represent a significant economic burden to healthcare systems worldwide. Since biosimilars are similar and more affordable versions of previously licenced biotechnologicals, they are expected to contribute to healthcare system sustainability and reduce inequities in treatment access. The landmark approval of CT-P13 as the first infliximab biosimilar paved the way for new infliximab but also etanercept, adalimumab and rituximab biosimilars. In Europe, North America and some countries of Asia, development is strictly regulated and only those presenting a totality-of-evidence dossier with highly similar physicochemical, biological and clinical performances are endorsed by regulatory agencies as biosimilars. The current article addresses the importance of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of IRD, as well as their innovative development and regulatory pathways, clinical evidence of similarity and challenges that may undermine their widespread use and success.

Abstract 55. Title: Biosimilars of Adalimumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Are we Ready for that?
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864505
Abstract: Biosimilars present a considerable potential to reduce costs related to clinical management allowing health-care providers to reinvest this money, leading to a wider access to an effective biological treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Infliximab biosimilars have already been incorporated in daily clinical practice and are currently used in all indications for which the reference product (RP) was approved. Areas covered: In the next few years, also adalimumab biosimilars will become available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In fact, several of them (ABP501, BI 695501, GP2017, and SB5) have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with the same indications of the reference product (Humira ®). Initial preclinical data proved a strong similarity between all biosimilars and the RP. Moreover, phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis showed no differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Data on IBD patients are urgently needed. Expert opinion: Biosimilars of adalimumab showed equivalent clinical efficacy to the RP in other immunemediated diseases. However, defining the ideal patient's profile to receive or to be switched to a biosimilar, choosing one biosimilar vs. another, or cross-switching among biosimilars, will become the next challenge in IBD.

Abstract 56. Title: Switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: 12 months results.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28902041
Abstract: Biological agents, such as infliximab, have transformed the outcomes of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The advent of biosimilar treatment options such as CT-P13 promises to improve the availability of biological therapy, yet real-world switching data are currently limited. Here, we assess the effectiveness and safety of switching to CT-P13 from infliximab reference product (RP) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
This was a prospective single-center observational study in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). All patients were switched from infliximab RP (Remicade) to CT-P13 treatment and followed up for up to 12 months. The efficacy endpoint was the change in clinical response assessed at 3-monthly intervals, according to the Harvey-Bradshaw score and partial Mayo score for patients with CD and UC, respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) was also measured. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the study.
A total of 98 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (67 CD/31 UC) were included. A total of 83.6% (56/67) of patients with CD were in remission at the time of the switch and 62.7% were in remission at 12 months. The Harvey-Bradshaw score showed a significant change at 12 months (P=0.007) but no significant change was observed in median CRP at this timepoint (P=0.364). A total of 80.6% (25/31) of patients with UC were in remission at the time of the switch and 65.3% (18/28) were in remission at 12 months. No significant changes in the median partial Mayo score (P=0.058) or CRP (P=0.329) were observed at 12 months. Serious adverse events related to medication were reported in 11 (11.2%) patients.
Switching from infliximab RP to CT-P13 is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with CD or UC for up to 12 months.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281165
Abstract: CT-P13 is a biosimilar of Remicade<sup>®</sup>, an agent approved in some countries for use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in rheumatic diseases, but not in IBD.
To assess the effectiveness and safety of CT-P13 in IBD patients in real clinical practice.
This is a prospective observational study in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis treated with CT-P13. The study was performed in one single center. Patients included were naive or switched to anti-TNF treatment from the reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) to CT-P13. Efficacy and safety were assessed in naive and switched patients who were in remission at the time of the switch at months 3 and 6 of therapy.
87.5 and 83.9% of switched CD patients who were in remission at the time of the switch continued in remission, and 66.7 and 50% of naive CD patients reached remission, at months 3 and 6. In UC switched cases, 92 and 91.3% of patients in remission at the time of the switch continued in remission, at 3 and 6 months. In naive UC patients, the remission rates were 44.4 and 66.7%, at months 3 and 6. Adverse events occurred in 7.5% of patients during 6 months of study.
CT-P13 was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with CD or UC.

Abstract 58. Title: Nurses are Critical in Aiding Patients Transitioning to Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Education and Communication Strategies.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30285235
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease and the high costs associated with biologic therapies suggest that biologics with lower costs, but no compromise on efficacy and safety, should be considered when developing a treatment plan for inflammatory bowel disease. Biosimilars offer a more cost-effective alternative, and although the European Medicines Agency has approved the use of biosimilars for many indications, including inflammatory bowel disease, patients may be concerned about the safety and efficacy of these agents. The updated Nurses-European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation statements, published in March 2018, recommend that inflammatory bowel disease nurses facilitate patient choice of biologic or biosimilar therapy. Nurses are pivotal in managing the challenges associated with patients transitioning to biosimilars. However, there is limited information available on how inflammatory bowel disease nurses can communicate the concept of biosimilars to patients and also on how best to support them before and during the switch from originators. This review article will focus on patients' concerns regarding biosimilars and describe considerations for nurses when supporting patients transitioning from originators to biosimilars. Through nurse-led patient education and the use of structured communication strategies, as well as investment in managed switching programmes, patients will become more confident and adherent to their biosimilar therapy, and this may lead to overall reductions in health-care expenditure for inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract 59. Title: Enhancing treatment success in inflammatory bowel disease: Optimising the use of anti-TNF agents and utilising their biosimilars in clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32601035
Abstract: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents such as infliximab and adalimumab have greatly altered the treatment landscape in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there are remaining unmet needs and opportunities to optimise their use. Recent data suggest that proactive therapeutic drug monitoring may lead to more efficient usage of these agents, with potential for higher rates of corticosteroid-free clinical remission than with reactive monitoring. Expanded application of faecal calprotectin measurements may also be valuable, given the ease of use of the assay and its proven effectiveness as a diagnostic tool and predictor of relapse risk. From a practical viewpoint, improved multidisciplinary working may be essential to optimise patient care, with IBD nurse specialists playing an increasingly central role within this model. Finally, the availability of biosimilars of the anti-TNF agents allow drug costs to be reduced without compromising safety or efficacy - thereby providing opportunities to improve accessibility. Alongside extensive data on originator to biosimilar infliximab switch, new studies are beginning to demonstrate the safety of biosimilar to biosimilar switch, as well as adalimumab biosimilar transitions. The risk of a nocebo effect when switching to a biosimilar can be reduced through improved patient education and preparation.

Abstract 60. Title: The PROSIT Cohort of Infliximab Biosimilar in IBD: A Prolonged Follow-up on the Effectiveness and Safety Across Italy.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-21
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137352
Abstract: We report a prospective, nationwide cohort evaluating the safety and effectiveness of CT-P13.
A structured database was used to record serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical remission/response, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and calprotectin), and endoscopic findings.
Eight hundred ten patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (452 Crohn's disease [CD]) were enrolled. Four hundred fifty-nine patients were naïve to anti-TNFα (group A), 196 had a previous exposure (group B), and the remaining 155 were switched to CT-P13 (group C). All patients were included in the safety evaluation with a mean follow-up of 345 ± 215 days and a total number of 6501 infusions. One hundred fifty-four SAEs were reported (19%), leading to cessation of the biosimilar in 103 subjects (12.7%). Infusion reactions were 71, leading to cessation of the biosimilar in 53 subjects (6.5%), being significantly more frequent in patients pre-exposed to anti-TNFα (P = 0.017). The efficacy of therapy was calculated in 754 IBD patients, with a mean follow-up of 329 ± 202 days. Forty-eight patients had a primary failure (6.4%), and 188 (25.6%) lost response during follow-up. Six hundred twenty-eight (364 CD) and 360 IBD patients (222 CD) completed the follow-up at 6 and 12 months, respectively. At 12 months, patients without loss of response were 71%, 64%. and 82% in groups A, B, and C, respectively (log rank P = 0.01). Clinical/endoscopic scores and inflammatory biomarkers dropped significantly in CD and UC patients (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001) compared with baseline.
In this large prospective cohort, no further signals of difference in safety and effectiveness of CT-P13 in IBD has been observed.

Abstract 61. Title: Health technology assessment of biosimilars worldwide: a scoping review.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-26
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843051
Abstract: Health technology assessment (HTA) should provide an assessment of a technology's effects on health and of the related social, economic, organisational and ethical issues. HTA reports on biosimilars can specifically assess their immunogenicity, their extrapolation to one or more conditions, and the risks of interchangeability and substitution. We aimed to complete a scoping review within the context of HTA organisations to synthesise HTA reports on biosimilars and to map the extension, scope and methodological practices.
A scoping review methodology was applied. The sources for biosimilars HTA reports were database searches and grey literature from HTA organisation websites up to June 2019. HTA reports of biosimilars were classified as full HTA, mini-HTA or rapid reviews. Data were extracted and recorded on a calibrated predefined data form. We identified 70 HTA reports of biosimilars of 16 biologic products (65.71% in 2015-2018) produced by 13 HTA organisations from 10 countries; 2 full HTAs, 4 mini-HTAs and 64 rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria. Almost all the rapid reviews gave no information regarding any evidence synthesis method and approximately half of the rapid reviews did not appraise the risk of bias of primary studies or the overall quality of evidence. All full-HTAs and mini-HTAs addressed organisational, ethical, social and legal considerations, while these factors were assessed in less than half of the rapid reviews. The immunogenicity and extrapolation of one or more conditions were often considered. The majority of full-HTAs and mini-HTAs contained an assessment of switching and a discussion of an educational approach about biosimilars. No HTA report rejected the adoption/reimbursement of the biosimilar assessed.
HTA of biosimilars are emerging in the context of HTA organisations and those that exist often duplicate reports of the same biosimilar. Most HTA reports of biosimilars do not conduct a systematic literature review or consider economic issues. No report has rejected the adoption/reimbursement of biosimilars. There is a need to standardise the minimum criteria for the development of HTA on biosimilars to ensure a better understanding and better decision-making.

Abstract 62. Title: How to select a nanosimilar.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28715605
Abstract: Nanomedicines in the class of nonbiological complex drugs (NBCDs) are becoming increasingly available. Up to 23 nanomedicines have been approved, and approximately 50 are in clinical development. Meanwhile, the first nanosimilars have entered the market through the generic approval pathway, but clinical differences have been observed. Many healthcare professionals may be unaware of this issue and must be informed of these clinically relevant variances. This article provides a tool for rational decision making for the inclusion of nanomedicines into the hospital formulary, including defined criteria for evaluation of substitutability or interchangeability. The tool was generated by conducting a roundtable with an international panel of experts and follows the same thought process that was developed and published earlier for the selection of biologicals/biosimilars. In addition to the existing criteria for biosimilars, a set of seven criteria was identified that specifically apply to nanosimilars. These include (1) particle size and size distribution, (2) particle surface characteristics, (3) fraction of uncaptured bioactive moiety, (4) stability on storage, (5) bioactive moiety uptake and (6) distribution, and (7) stability for ready-to-use preparation. Pharmacists should utilize their pharmaceutical expertise to use the appropriate criteria to evaluate the comparability of the drug to decide on interchangeability or substitutability.

Abstract 63. Title: The Experience with Biosimilars of Infliximab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29205114
Abstract: biosimilars are similar versions of existing innovator biologic agents but with distinct manufacturing processes. They were approved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by extrapolation of indication from rheumatic diseases. As regulatory requirements for biosimilar approval focus on pre-clinical evidence of similarity rather than clinical data on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity, it is critical to review clinical evidence supporting their use in IBD in order to overcome reluctance from patients and clinicians alike.
to review clinical studies using infliximab (IFX) biosimilars in IBD.
we reviewed PubMed for original articles published up to July 1st 2017, reporting data on efficacy and/or safety of IFX biosimilars in IBD.
23 observational studies were found, 12 of them assessing switch from IFX originator to biosimilar and 17 assessing induction therapy with IFX biosimilar. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were compared, generally yielding similar results for originator and biosimilar IFX. So far only one randomized controlled trial assessed switching from originator to biosimilar IFX and it was not powered to show similarity in IBD. Ongoing trials are comparing IFX biosimilar and originator head to head in patients in remission, as well as switch versus reverse-switch. Current IBD clinical guidelines are discussed as well as future perspectives for biosimilars in IBD.
observational studies seem to confirm biosimilarity in a real-world clinical setting. Current trials are expected to elucidate the remaining doubts about clinical biosimilarity.

Abstract: The Brazilian Societies of Rheumatology (SBR) and Dermatology (SBD), the Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology (FBG) and the Brazilian Study Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GEDIIB) gathered a group of their respective specialists on the topic of interest to discuss the most relevant issues regarding the clinical use of biosimilar medicines in Brazil. The main aim of that meeting was to prepare a document with recommendations to guide medical specialists and to help the national regulatory and policy-making agencies as concerns the authorization for marketing biosimilars used in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to considerations on the typical differences between innovator medicines and biosimilars, the specialists established a set of seven recommendations on regulatory advances related to clinical studies, indication extrapolation, nomenclature, interchangeability, automatic substitution and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract 65. Title: The Experience with Biosimilars of Infliximab in Rheumatic Diseases.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29189135
Abstract: Infliximab biosimilars are the first biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies approved by the main regulatory agencies. Up to the present day, two infliximab biosimilars have been approved: CT-P13 (Celltrion), and SB2 (Biogen), but other companies have been developing candidate infliximab biosimilars that are on clinical trials: PF 06438179 (Pfizer), the ABP710 (bioCentury/Amgen) the BCD055 (JSC Biocad Russica) and BOW015 (Epirus).
We have made a literature search in MedLine database using the key words [Infliximab] and [biosimilars] and [rheumatic diseases] and [rheumatisms]. We have also made a search in the clinicaltrials.org website.
Clinical data published so far have provided important evidence on long-term efficacy and safety, immunogenicity and switching, supporting the use of CT-P13 and SB2 for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In addition, the European experience has proved the economic advantages of the incorporation of infliximab biosimilars in clinical practice. Despite the widespread use of infliximab biosimilars there is still a lack of data regarding interchangeability between reference products and biosimilars.

Abstract 66. Title: Cost-effectiveness of biological treatment sequences for fistulising Crohn's disease across Europe.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29511561
Abstract: In clinical practice, treatment sequences of biologicals are applied for active fistulising Crohn's disease, however underlying health economic analyses are lacking.
The purpose of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of different biological sequences including infliximab, biosimilar-infliximab, adalimumab and vedolizumab in nine European countries.
A Markov model was developed to compare treatment sequences of one, two and three biologicals from the payer's perspective on a five-year time horizon. Data on effectiveness and health state utilities were obtained from the literature. Country-specific costs were considered. Calculations were performed with both official list prices and estimated real prices of biologicals.
Biosimilar-infliximab is the most cost-effective treatment against standard care across the countries (with list prices: €34684-€72551/quality adjusted life year; with estimated real prices: €24364-€56086/quality adjusted life year). The most cost-effective two-agent sequence, except for Germany, is the biosimilar-infliximab-adalimumab therapy compared with single biosimilar-infliximab (with list prices: €58533-€133831/quality adjusted life year; with estimated prices: €45513-€105875/quality adjusted life year). The cost-effectiveness of the biosimilar-infliximab-adalimumab-vedolizumab three-agent sequence compared wit biosimilar-infliximab -adalimumab is €87214-€152901/quality adjusted life year.
The suggested first-choice biological treatment is biosimilar-infliximab. In case of treatment failure, switching to adalimumab then to vedolizumab provides meaningful additional health gains but at increased costs. Inter-country differences in cost-effectiveness are remarkable due to significant differences in costs.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551802
Abstract: In observational studies of patients switched from stable treatment with an originator monoclonal antibody (mAb) to a biosimilar, higher rates of biosimilar discontinuation versus those observed in blinded switching studies have been reported. Because this observation relates to the real-world setting, it has been suggested that switching outside of clinical trials may be associated with nocebo effects. However, real-world data on drug discontinuation and nocebo effects after switching to mAb biosimilars remain limited. This systematic review collated information from switching studies regarding discontinuation rates of biosimilar mAbs and investigated the subjectivity of reasons for discontinuation to determine the impact of potential nocebo responses.
MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and abstract databases of selected congresses were screened for reports of mAb switching studies with a minimum post-switch follow-up ≥6 months and accessible information on discontinuation rates.
A total of 14 observational studies were included, all of which involved a switch to CT-P13. Ten interventional studies involving a switch to other biosimilar mAbs were excluded from the analysis because nocebo effects relate to the observational setting only. Eleven studies (78.6%) reported biosimilar discontinuation rates that were higher than expected based on data pertaining to long-term use of the originator infliximab and clinical trials involving a switch to CT-P13 (>10% per year; range, 12.2%-28.2%). Eight studies attributed a proportion of discontinuations to subjective disease worsening or subjective adverse events. Subjective adverse event reports were identified in 7 of the observational studies.
Discontinuation rates of biosimilar mAbs may increase due to subjective effects after switching from an originator mAb. These findings highlight the need for further patient education and well-designed, observational switching studies as well as the collection and analysis of identifiable pharmacovigilance and postmarketing data of biologics, including biosimilars. The collection of real-world results is particularly pertinent for mAbs other than CT-P13, for which there is currently a lack of observational switching data.

Abstract 68. Title: Frequency and characteristics of infusion reactions during biosimilar infliximab treatment in inflammatory bowel diseases: results from Central European nationwide cohort.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504555
Abstract: Safety data of the 'real life' use of an infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are still lacking. Our aim was to assess the frequency and characteristics of infusion reactions during CT-P13 therapy in 13 Hungarian and 1 Czech IBD centres.
Clinical and safety data was registered at fixed appointments. Trough levels and anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentration were measured by ELISA. Association between demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and infusion reaction rates were evaluated statistically.
Three hundred and eighty-four IBD patients were included. Twenty-eight Hungarian IBD patients (9.6%) developed infusion reaction during the treatment, 64.3% of them was previously exposed to anti TNF therapy. No infusion reaction occurred in the Czech population. CT-P13 therapy had to be stopped in 17 patients who developed infusion reaction and was switched to adalimumab in 12 patients. However in 39.3% of patients developing infusion reaction CT-P13 therapy was continued with the use of premedication. Cumulative ADA positivity rates were 8.7%, 19.3%, and 28.0% at weeks 0, 14, and 30. Previous anti-TNF-alpha exposure (30% vs. 3.1%, p < 0.001, OR 6.3 (2.7-14.6)) and ADA positivity (32.6% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.001, OR 19(5-73)) during the induction therapy were predictive factors for infusion reactions.
Patients with previous exposure to anti-TNF-alpha and ADA positivity during the induction therapy were more likely to develop infusion reactions.

Abstract 69. Title: The Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Switching Between Reference Biopharmaceuticals and Biosimilars: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32236956
Abstract: To date, no consensus exists among stakeholders about switching patients between reference biological products (RPs) and biosimilars, which may have been curbing the implementation of biosimilars in clinical practice. This study synthesizes the available data on switching and assesses whether switching patients from a RP to its biosimilar or vice versa affects efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity outcomes. A total of 178 studies, in which switch outcomes from a RP to a biosimilar were reported, was identified. Data were derived from both randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence. Despite the limitations stemming from a lack of a robust design for most of the studies, the available switching data do not indicate that switching from a RP to a biosimilar is associated with any major efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity issues. Some open-label and observational studies reported increased discontinuation rates after switching, which were mainly attributed to nocebo effects. Involvement of the prescriber in any decision to switch should remain and attention should be paid to the mitigation of a potential nocebo effect.

Abstract 70. Title: European Stakeholder Learnings Regarding Biosimilars: Part II-Improving Biosimilar Use in Clinical Practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33063267
Abstract: Despite the benefits biosimilars offer in terms of cost savings and patient access, healthcare professionals and patients have been reluctant to use them. Next to insufficient understanding of and trust in biosimilars, healthcare professionals and patients have questions about switching and the nocebo effect when using biosimilars in clinical practice. In addition, clear motivation to use biosimilars may be lacking among these stakeholders.
This study aims to provide recommendations on how to improve biosimilar use on both a clinical and a practical level based on insights from healthcare professionals (physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses), patients (or their representatives), and regulators across Europe.
We conducted 44 semi-structured interviews with experts from five stakeholder groups across Europe: physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses, regulators, and patients/representatives. Interviews were transcribed ad verbatim and transcripts analysed according to the thematic framework method.
Based on the insights and considerations of the experts interviewed, we identified a number of recommendations to improve the use of biosimilars in clinical practice. Regarding switch implementation, the experts voiced support for the following actions: (1) disseminate evidence from and experience with (multiple) switching; (2) provide clear, one-voice regulatory guidance about the interchangeability of biosimilars and their reference product; (3) apply a multi-stakeholder implementation and communication protocol to guide switching in clinical practice; (4) apply a pragmatic approach when taking switch decisions; and (5) avoid mandated switching, allowing stakeholder communication and alignment. When discussing approaches to increase the willingness of stakeholders to use biosimilars, we concluded that actions should be centred on (1) communicating the benefits provided by biosimilars and the introduction of market competition, (2) increasing awareness among stakeholders about medicine prices and their societal responsibility to use medicines in a cost-effective manner, (3) transparent reporting about the allocation of savings, (4) sharing biosimilar usage data among hospitals and prescribers to allow peer-to-peer benchmarking, and (5) applying a balanced combination of tangible and non-tangible incentives that can be tailored to offset the time and effort expended by stakeholders when switching to a biosimilar.
This study proposes a number of strategic, practical, and overarching recommendations to support healthcare professionals and inform decision makers to improve the clinical use of biosimilars and the willingness of stakeholders to use them. The proposed solutions to fully realise the potential of biosimilars for healthcare systems and patients include developing practical switch guidance, being transparent about the gains from biosimilar use (and how savings are allocated), and developing a combination of non-tangible and tangible incentives for involved stakeholders.

Abstract 71. Title: European Stakeholder Learnings Regarding Biosimilars: Part I-Improving Biosimilar Understanding and Adoption.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33141421
Abstract: Despite the benefits offered by biosimilars in terms of cost savings and improved patient access to biological therapies, and an established regulatory pathway in Europe, biosimilar adoption is challenged by a lack of knowledge and understanding among stakeholders such as healthcare professionals and patients about biosimilars, impacting their trust and willingness to use them. In addition, stakeholders are faced with questions about clinical implementation aspects such as switching.
This study aims to provide recommendations on how to improve biosimilar understanding and adoption among stakeholders based on insights of healthcare professionals (physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses), patient(s) (representatives) and regulators across Europe.
The study consists of a structured literature review gathering original research data on stakeholder knowledge about biosimilars, followed by semi-structured interviews across five stakeholder groups including physicians, hospital pharmacists, nurses, patient(s) (representatives) and regulators across Europe.
Although improvement in knowledge was observed over time, generally low to moderate levels of awareness, knowledge and trust towards biosimilars among healthcare professionals and patients are identified in literature (N studies = 106). Based on the provided insights from interviews with European experts (N = 44), a number of challenges regarding biosimilar stakeholder understanding are identified, including a lack of practical information about biosimilars and their use, a lack of understanding about biosimilar concepts and a lack of knowledge about biologicals in general. Misinformation by originator industry is also believed to have impacted stakeholder trust. In terms of possible solutions and actions to improve stakeholder understanding, broad support exists to (1) organize initiatives focussed on explaining the rationale behind biosimilar concepts and the approval pathway, (2) invest in education about biologicals in general, (3) develop clear and one-voice regulatory guidance about biosimilar interchangeability and switching across Europe, (4) disseminate real-world clinical biosimilar (switch) data, (5) share biosimilar experiences by key opinion leaders and among peers, (6) provide practical biosimilar product information, (7) provide guidance about biosimilar use, (8) actively counterbalance misinformation and organize information initiatives by neutral entities, (9) organize multi-stakeholder informational and educational efforts, aligning information between involved stakeholder groups and (10) design initiatives in a way that ensures active information uptake. Furthermore, interviewees argue that governments should be proactive in these regards.
This study argues in favour of a structural, multi-stakeholder framework at both European and national level to improve stakeholder biosimilar understanding and acceptance. It proposes a number of actionable recommendations that can inform policy making and guide stakeholders, which can contribute to realizing healthcare system benefits offered by biosimilar competition.

Abstract 72. Title: Patient satisfaction survey: substitution of reference etanercept with a biosimilar product.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33608440
Abstract: To assess patient satisfaction after pharmacy-mediated replacement of the originator etanercept prefilled syringe with its biosimilar prefilled pen.
Prospective observational study from March to May 2018, to assess satisfaction with the new drug dispensed. Patients were asked to answer a paper questionnaire with three questions: pain at injection site, ease of administration, and overall patient satisfaction with the change, rated on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied).
The questionnaire was given to 134 patients (74 men, 60 women), with an average age of 55 years. 118 patients (88%) were from the Rheumatology Service and 16 patients (12%) from Dermatology. The median treatment duration with etanercept was 61 months. 87 (65%) completed questionnaires were collected. The mean pain score was 3.4. Most patients found administration easy with the biosimilar pen, with an average score of 3.7. Mean overall satisfaction was rated at 3.3, being higher among men, younger patients, and those with shorter duration of treatment.
The change of the original product from etanercept to a biosimilar product was acceptable for most of the patients who responded to the survey. Surveys allow us to determine the opinion and preferences of patients, thus achieving higher satisfaction with their treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of automatic replacement. A collaborative multidisciplinary switching programme should be implemented based on the feedback provided by patients.

Abstract 73. Title: Efficacy and safety of biosimilar rituximab in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris: a single center experience of 12 cases.
Publication Date: 2022-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32068447
Abstract: Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD-20 molecule on B-cells' surface, has led to significant advances in the treatment of autoimmune pemphigus in recent decades. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy as well as safety data for biosimilar rituximab with emphasis on the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris.
A total of 12 individuals with pemphigus vulgaris treated with biosimilar rituximab were followed for at least 1 year. We assessed patient characteristics, disease history, pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) score, anti-desmoglein (Dsg)1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody level, clinical response, and any adverse events during each clinical follow-up visit. We also recorded time to achieve complete remission, duration of complete remission and time to relapse.
A consistent decrease in the PDAI score was observed (<i>p</i><.0001), as well as a significant decrease of anti-Dsg3 values. In addition, the clinical response of this population confirmed that the equivalent is not inferior to Rituximab (<i>p</i>=.521).
The introduction or the switch to Rixathon, a rituximab biosimilar, appears to be safe and may provide an opportunity to reduce health system costs because of its similarity to the reference drug in terms of safety and efficacy.

Abstract 74. Title: Anti-TNF biosimilars in psoriasis: from scientific evidence to real-world experience.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31094242
Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors account for a large proportion of drugs used to treat psoriasis and are indicated first-line options in certain settings. Several biosimilar drugs based on the anti-TNF agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept are now available for use in patients with psoriasis. The favorable cost differential of biosimilars is expected to improve access to biologic therapy for biologic-naive psoriasis patients, who are often undertreated. Also, substantial cost savings can be made if patients are switched to biosimilars. To date, most clinical testing of anti-TNF biosimilars approved for use in psoriasis has been performed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the results extrapolated to psoriasis. Although this may initially raise concerns for clinicians looking to start their psoriasis patients on biologic treatment with a biosimilar or switch from an original biologic to a biosimilar, the process of extrapolation is tightly regulated and scientifically justified. Furthermore, available real-world evidence of the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF agents in patients with psoriasis complements clinical trial data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. When equipped with the appropriate knowledge, clinicians should have confidence to use biosimilars for the treatment of psoriasis.

Abstract 75. Title: A review of the literature analyzing benefits and concerns of infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 for the treatment of rheumatologic diseases: focus on interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28721016
Abstract: The introduction of biological agents drastically changed the treatment paradigm of inflammatory arthritides, ameliorating the natural history of the diseases but concomitantly increasing the drug costs due to the manufacturing process. On this concern, biosimilar drugs may represent a valid option for reducing this elevated cost and increasing the availability of these highly effective treatments. Recently, CT-P13, the first biosimilar of infliximab, has been approved with the same indications established for the reference product (RP), and its daily use is progressively increasing. However, the experience with biosimilar drugs in the field of rheumatology is still limited, raising potential doubts and concerns on their correct management in real-life settings. Comparability analysis between CT-P13 and its RP was evaluated in equivalence randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - PLANETRA and PLANETAS - performed on patients with rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondylitis, respectively. CT-P13 and RP showed similar profile in terms of quality, biological activity, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. However, the interchangeability between infliximab RP and its biosimilar still represents the most challenging issue because of a lack of a long-lasting experience. To date, reassuring preliminary data on this topic were reported in open-label extensions of PLANETRA and PLANETAS RCTs and in ongoing real-life observational studies. These findings, taken all together, significantly affect the landscape of biosimilar regulatory pathways and strongly support CT-P13 introduction as a great opportunity for expanding the accessibility to these very effective and high-cost therapies.

Abstract 76. Title: Rheumatologists' Perceptions of Biosimilar Medicines Prescription: Findings from a French Web-Based Survey.
Publication Date: 2016-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848166
Abstract: Healthcare cost savings are closely linked to prescribers' confidence in and acceptance of the prescription of biosimilar drugs.
The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, experience and opinions of hospital-based and office-based French rheumatologists with regard to biosimilar medicines and to identify the barriers to and possible options to promote their prescription.
A web-based, self-administered survey was conducted among French rheumatologists from June 8 to August 2, 2015.
A total of 116 rheumatologists responded to the survey. Many reported having little knowledge and a lack of available information about biosimilar drugs, especially office-based rheumatologists. 98.3% of the respondents had at least one question about biosimilars, and seven in ten raised issues regarding substitution, iatrogenic effects or cost savings that might be achievable. Only eight rheumatologists had already prescribed a biosimilar drug. The most common barriers reported were indication extrapolation and a lack of data about tolerability. Nine out of ten physicians thought that starting a treatment with a biosimilar drug in biologic treatment-naïve patients was possible. The rheumatologists' opinions were rather favorable towards the implementation of biosimilars, but a majority expressed a negative opinion about substitution by the pharmacist.
Our survey gave a better appreciation of the concerns associated with biosimilar prescriptions. Targeted communication initiatives, deeper experience and availability of new clinical data may help to address the outstanding questions and should overcome the misunderstandings surrounding biosimilar drugs among rheumatologists.

Abstract 77. Title: Knowledge, behaviors and practices of community and hospital pharmacists towards biosimilar medicines: Results of a French web-based survey.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27929743
Abstract: This study's aims were: 1) to extract a comprehensive overview of the knowledge, experience and opinions of both community pharmacists and hospital pharmacists regarding biosimilar medicines in France; and 2) to identify the perceived problems and solutions to promoting their prescription. A 2015 web-based survey was conducted by the Observatoire des Médicaments, des Dispositifs Médicaux et de l'Innovation Thérapeutique of Alsace. A total of 802 pharmacists responded to the survey. Many (536, 66.8%, [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.6-70.1]) indicated that they were not familiar with biosimilars. Half of community pharmacists (95% CI 42.7-57.3) stated that they were not at all informed about biosimilar drugs, compared with 15.7% (95% CI 12.9-18.6) of hospital pharmacists. Almost all respondents (781, 97.4%, [95% CI 96.3-98.5]) had at least one pending question on biosimilars. Most of the questions were related to the manufacturing process, safety, substitution rules and the international non-proprietary name prescription. At the time of the study, 467 pharmacists (58.2%, [95% CI 54.8-61.6]) had already validated a prescription for a biosimilar drug, mainly for filgrastim. These latter were more comfortable in explaining the benefit of biosimilar medicines to the patient. Pharmacists were rather favorable to biosimilar drugs, and about 9 of 10 quoted healthcare cost savings as incentives to their prescription. However, many did not agree with allowing biosimilar substitution. "Patients' wishes to be treated with the originator" and "indication extrapolation" were the two main constraints identified. The survey highlighted the need to provide French pharmacists with accurate and comprehensive information regarding biosimilar medicines.

Abstract 78. Title: Biosimilar infliximab for the management of rheumatoid arthritis in France: what are the expected savings?
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31156910
Abstract: Biosimilar infliximab, the first similar biological medicinal product containing monoclonal antibodies to be commercialised, is likely to contribute to a significant reduction in healthcare costs. We aimed to assess the cost savings potential over 1 year of the use of biosimilar infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in Alsace and in France, in a real-life setting.
The analysis was based on a previously conducted observational study which evaluated the annual cost of the care of patients with RA treated with biological therapies in 2012 in Alsace. Average annual costs to manage RA patients were calculated, taking into account the decrease in the retail price between 2012 and 2015 (as given in the official national price list) and the local negotiated price for biosimilar infliximab. Annual cost savings for different biosimilar prescription scenarios were calculated using 2015 prices.
Management of RA patients with biosimilar infliximab was significantly cheaper than with adalimumab or etanercept (€11 907 vs €12 981 and €13 551, respectively). The projected annual cost savings reached €13.6 million nationally, if all adult RA patients treated with the originator infliximab switched to the biosimilar drug. These savings, if fully reallocated for the treatment of RA, would enable the treatment of 1141 additional patients.
The study showed a positive financial impact of introducing biosimilar infliximab for the treatment of RA patients in France. Such savings could contribute to improved patient care by allowing more patients to be treated without more money being spent.

Abstract 79. Title: Bilateral Sub-deltoid Bursitis in a Patient Receiving Infliximab for Crohn's Disease.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483235
Abstract: Infiximab has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission of intestinal bowel diseases. Infiximab has been associated with many adverse events. Articular manifestations are commonly reported, but they are of variable clinical expression and aetiology. Among them, inflammatory bursitis has rarely been described.
Herein a case of inflammatory bursitis in a patient with Crohn's disease after switching to biosimilar infliximab is reported.
A 41-year-old man with Crohn's disease evolving from 3 years was referred to infliximab therapy at a dose of 5mg/kg because of an aggressive resistant perineal fistula. After 14 infusions of infliximab, the treatment was switched to infliximab biosimilar using the same dose and frequency of administration. Forty-eight hours after the second infusion, he developed an acute onset of muscle pain and stiffness on both of his shoulders. A musculoskeletal ultrasound was performed and revealed a hypoechoic widening of both subacromial bursae. It was more severe on the left side.
The diagnosis of non-infective sub-acromial bursitis secondary to infliximab infusion was made as the patient's symptoms resolved rapidly without any antibiotics. Infliximab was definitively stopped and adalimumab was introduced.
Musculoskeletal side effects of infliximab infusion are uncommonly reported. Among them, bursitis has been reported in only a few cases. Ultrasonography can help early diagnosis of bursitis. The time of occurring of this reaction regarding infliximab infusion, screening of Antibodies to Infliximab (ATI) and clinical outcome after drug discontinuation are the main helpful arguments.

Abstract 80. Title: Assessing switchability for biosimilar products: modelling approaches applied to children's growth.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25989222
Abstract: The present paper describes two statistical modelling approaches that have been developed to demonstrate switchability from the original recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) formulation (Genotropin(®) ) to a biosimilar product (Omnitrope(®) ) in children suffering from growth hormone deficiency. Demonstrating switchability between rhGH products is challenging because the process of growth varies with the age of the child and across children. The first modelling approach aims at predicting individual height measured at several time-points after switching to the biosimilar. The second modelling approach provides an estimate of the deviation from the overall growth rate after switching to the biosimilar, which can be regarded as an estimate of switchability. The results after applying these approaches to data from a randomized clinical trial are presented. The accuracy and precision of the predictions made using the first approach and the small deviation from switchability estimated with the second approach provide sufficient evidence to conclude that switching from Genotropin(®) to Omnitrope(®) has a very small effect on growth, which is neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant.

Abstract 81. Title: [Switching from one drug therapy to another with the same therapeutic indication without harms.].
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29149162
Abstract: The loss of exclusivity from several drug therapies largely used bring new attention the issues of safety, efficacy and following the switch from one drug to another (i.e., biosimilar and/or generics) with the same indication. This is not a problem that can be related to regulatory or economical factors. The increase of patients exposed to chronic conditions and the introductions or more pharmaceutical alternatives with same therapeutic indications yield for studies able to verify the effectiveness and safety even when switch from more drugs is considered by practitioners. Recent multiregional studies showed that the switch from phenomenon is not a rare event, especially with biologic drugs, frequent even before the introduction of biosimilar not only because of economical reasons. For instance, a study made in our region (Lazio) showed that around 17% of patients treated with epoetins have been exposed to same kind of switch between drugs with same therapeutic indications. In this context it became crucial to explore new methodologies in order to verify before and after drug registrations how the potential switching affect final health outcomes. Limitations and design of the new studies need to be critically analysed.

Abstract 82. Title: [Appropriate use of trastuzumab in Lazio Region: therapeutic scenarios and estimation of possible savings for the Regional Health Service.].
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31909763
Abstract: The availability of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (EV) formulations of trastuzumab and the recent release of the biosimilar EV version (10/2018) increase the offer for the treatment of patients with breast or gastric cancer HER2 positive. In this context, it is necessary to build therapeutic scenarios form avalible data in order to estimate the potential savings for the Regional Health Service (RHS) taking into account the appropriateness of use and patient's preferences.
To evaluate the available comparative evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the different trastuzumab formulations; to analyze the supply of trastuzumab by type of administration (EV/SC) in Lazio in 2018, identifying the most appropriate use; to hypothesize a cost-effective scenario for the Regional Health Service (SSR) in 2019. Mehods. With the working group formed by clinicians and methodologists, we analysed the evidence of efficacy and safety available to date for the different formulations of trastuzumab, also taking into account the recent availability of biosimilars and with particular regard to the phenomenon of the potential switch between different therapeutic options. In addition, for the year 2019 the available economic impact assessments were also simulated with data from the Lazio Region. Through the datas from direct pharmaceutical products, the transtuzumab cycles supplied in 2018 were identified separately for the available formulations (EV/SC). For each cycle of therapy, starting from the date of delivery, the possible presence of a concomitant treatment (± 2 days) was investigated, tracing the type and method of administration. The treatments (concomitant with trastuzumab) were identified for which there were conflicting modes of administration. In addition, the supply of SC per dispensing structure was evaluated and, on the basis of this information, a scenario of use was hypothesized that takes into account costs and plausible consumption.
A review of the literature summarized the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of the use of trastuzumab in the recorded therapeutic indications. The review was discussed with the working group and used to reproduce, at regional level, the estimates of the economic impact of the different therapeutic choices possible with trastuzumab. As regards the data on the use of trastuzumab, in the Lazio Region in 2018, 22,214 treatment cycles were observed (at a cost of 33 million euro) for 2,407 patients; new users accounted for 52.2%. 46.8% of the cycles were administered via SC; the use of the biosimilar was observed from October onwards and involved 143 cycles (0.6%). In 68.4% of the cycles trastuzumab was administered in monotherapy; among the therapies associated with trastuzumab, the most frequent was pertuzumab (n=4,258, 19.2% of the total cycles), followed by paclitaxel (n=1,364, 6.1% of the total cycles). Among the cycles of trastuzumab in concomitant therapy (N=7,022), 17.3% was administered via SC despite the presence of other drugs administered via EV. The prescriptive pattern of trastuzumab was heterogeneous for the different delivery structures. The SC administration presents a variability in the supply from 26% to 70% (interquartile range) and does not seem to be related to the type and volume of activity of the hospital. If the biosimilar EV is expected to account for 55% of consumption by 2019, thus reducing the use of the EV originator to 10% and the SC originator to 35%, savings of more than €7 million.
Through the use data of the different formulations available for trastuzumab and taking into account the prescriptive appropriateness (and patient preferences), it has been possible to identify a SSR scenario of economic convenience due to the greater use of the biosimilar.

Abstract 83. Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Switching Originator and Biosimilar Epoetins in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in a Large-Scale Italian Cohort Study.
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31228010
Abstract: Real-world data on the comparative effectiveness and safety of switching among different epoetins (including originators and biosimilars) are limited. In light of current debate about interchangeability, prescribers, some patient groups and decision makers are calling for additional post-marketing evidence on the clinical effects of switching between originator and biosimilar epoetins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of switching versus non-switching and of switching from originator/biosimilar epoetin alpha (ESA α) to any other epoetin in CKD patients.
An observational, record-linkage, multi-database, retrospective cohort study was carried out in four Italian geographical areas. All subjects with at least one ESA α dispensing between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015 were retrieved. Switching was defined as any transition between originator/biosimilar ESA α to any other epoetin in a series of two consecutive prescriptions up to 2 years. Switchers were matched 1:1 with non-switchers by baseline propensity score and by duration of ESA α treatment. Switchers and non-switchers were followed up from switching date to a maximum of 1 year. Lack of effectiveness and safety of switching versus non-switching were evaluated through Cox regression models (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]). A direct comparison between the two switcher categories (switchers from originator/biosimilar ESA α to any other epoetin) was also performed.
Overall, 14,400 incident users of ESA α for anaemia due to CKD (61.4% originator, 38.6% biosimilar) were available for analysis. During the follow-up, we found no differences on effectiveness (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79-1.31 originators; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.79 biosimilars) and safety outcomes (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77-1.50 originators; HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.66-2.21 biosimilars) between switchers and non-switchers of ESA α. Cumulative probabilities of recording an adverse event, either in terms of lack of effectiveness or safety issue, were the same for two switching categories CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale Italian observational multi-database study, switching versus non-switching as well as switching from biosimilar/originator ESA α to any other epoetin in CKD patients is not associated with any effectiveness and safety outcomes.

Abstract 84. Title: The First 2 Years of Biosimilar Epoetin for Cancer and Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia in the U.S.: A Review from the Southern Network on Adverse Reactions.
Publication Date: 2021-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33586299
Abstract: Biosimilars are biologic drug products that are highly similar to reference products in analytic features, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilar epoetin received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2018. The manufacturer received an FDA nonapproval letter in 2017, despite receiving a favorable review by FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) and an FDA nonapproval letter in 2015 for an earlier formulation. We discuss the 2018 FDA approval, the 2017 FDA ODAC Committee review, and the FDA complete response letters in 2015 and 2017; review concepts of litigation, naming, labeling, substitution, interchangeability, and pharmacovigilance; review European and U.S. oncology experiences with biosimilar epoetin; and review the safety of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In 2020, policy statements from AETNA, United Health Care, and Humana indicated that new epoetin oncology starts must be for biosimilar epoetin unless medical need for other epoetins is documented. Empirical studies report that as of 2012, reference epoetin use decreased from 40%-60% of all patients with cancer with chemotherapy-induced anemia to <5% of such patients because of safety concerns. Between 2018 and 2020, biosimilar epoetin use varied, increasing to 81% among one private insurer's patients covered by Medicare whose cancer care is administered with Oncology Analytics and to 41% with the same private insurer's patients with cancer covered by commercial health insurance and administered by the private insurer, to 0% in several Veterans Administration Hospitals, increasing to 100% in one large county hospital in California, and with yet-to-be-reported data from most oncology settings. We conclude that biosimilar epoetin appears to have overcome some barriers since 2015, although current uptake in the U.S. is variable. Pricing and safety considerations for all erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are primary determinants of biosimilar epoetin oncology uptake. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Few oncologists understand substitution and interchangeability of biosimilars with reference drugs. Epoetin biosimilar is new to the market, and physician and patient understanding is limited. The development of epoetin biosimilar is not familiar to oncologists.

Abstract 85. Title: Improving oncology biosimilar launches in the EU, the USA, and Japan: an updated Policy Review from the Southern Network on Adverse Reactions.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33271114
Abstract: The EU, the USA, and Japan account for the majority of biological pharmacotherapy use worldwide. Biosimilar regulatory approval pathways were authorised in the EU (2006), in Japan (2009), and in the USA (2015), to facilitate approval of biological drugs that are highly similar to reference products and to encourage market competition. Between 2007 and 2020, 33 biosimilars for oncology were approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), 16 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and ten by the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Some of these approved applications were initially rejected because of manufacturing concerns (four of 36 [11%] with the EMA, seven of 16 [44%] with the FDA, none of ten for the PMDA). Median times from initial regulatory submission before approval of oncology biosimilars were 1·5 years (EMA), 1·3 years (FDA), and 0·9 years (PMDA). Pharmacists can substitute biosimilars for reference biologics in some EU countries, but not in the USA or Japan. US regulation prohibits substitution, unless the biosimilar has been approved as interchangeable, a designation not yet achieved for any biosimilar in the USA. Japan does not permit biosimilar substitution, as prescribers must include the product name on each prescription and that specific product must be given to the patient. Policy Reviews published in 2014 and 2016 in The Lancet Oncology focused on premarket and postmarket policies for oncology biosimilars before most of these drugs received regulatory approval. In this Policy Review from the Southern Network on Adverse Reactions, we identify factors preventing the effective launch of oncology biosimilars. Introduction to the market has been more challenging with therapeutic than for supportive care oncology biosimilars. Addressing region-specific competition barriers and educational needs would improve the regulatory approval process and market launches for these biologics, therefore expanding patient access to these products in the EU, the USA, and Japan.

Abstract 86. Title: Safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of switching from innovator to biosimilar infliximab in patients with spondyloarthritis: a 6-month real-life observational study.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449503
Abstract: Biosimilar infliximab (INX) was recently approved by the European Medicine Agency for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and psoriasis on the grounds that its pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy were comparable to those of innovator INX. The aim of this study was to investigate the real-life efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of switching from innovator to biosimilar INX in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Forty-one patients attending three Italian rheumatology centres with a previous diagnosis of SpA and clinically inactive or moderate disease activity (ASDAS-CRP < 2.1; 22 with AS, five with enteropathic arthritis, 10 with PsA, and four with undifferentiated SpA), who had been treated for more than 6 months with innovator INX in accordance with the ASAS/EULAR guidelines, were switched to biosimilar INX for pharmaco-economic reasons (Tuscany Law No. 450 of 7 April 2015) and followed up for 6 months. A record was kept of their BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS-CRP, DAS28-CRP (in the presence of peripheral disease), MASES, VAS pain scores, the duration of morning stiffness, and adverse events (AEs). At the time of the switch, the patients had a median age of 50.9 years (range 23-80), a median disease duration of 124.5 months (range 14-372), and a median duration of treatment with innovator INX of 73.7 months (range 6-144). After 6 months of biosimilar INX therapy, there were no statistical differences in their median BASDAI (2.73 ± 1.5 vs. 2.6 ± 1.3, p = .27), BASFI (2.34 ± 1.3 vs. 2.17 ± 1.2, p = 0.051), ASDAS-CRP (1.35 ± 0.3 vs. 1.28 ± 0.2, p = 0.24), DAS28-CRP (2.66 ± 0.67 vs. 2.67 ± 0.35, p = 0.92), MASES (0.35 ± 0.7 vs. 0.17 ± 0.4, p = 0.08), or VAS pain scores (18 ± 14.7 vs. 16.7 ± 11.3, p = 0.55), whereas the median duration of morning stiffness had significantly decreased (7.2 ± 6.9 vs. 5.8 ± 6, p = 0.02). Furthermore, there was no change in circulating INX (4.22 ± 2.89 vs 4.84 ± 2.86 μg/mL, p = 0.80) or anti-INX antibody levels (27.76 ± 17.13 vs 27.27 ± 17.28 ng/mL, p = 0.98). The switch from innovator to biosimilar INX in this Italian multicentre SpA cohort was not associated with any statistically significance differences in efficacy, adverse events or anti-drug antibody level.

Abstract 87. Title: Switching from originator infliximab to the biosimilar CT-P13 in 313 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30344642
Abstract: As the patents of originator biologics are expiring, biosimilar versions are becoming available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, published switch studies of the first infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, have delivered ambiguous results that could be interpreted as showing a trend towards inferior effectiveness in Crohn's disease (CD) compared with ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of switching IBD patients from treatment with Remicade to CT-P13.
In this prospective observational cohort study, all adult IBD patients on Remicade treatment, at four hospitals, were switched to CT-P13. The primary endpoint was change in clinical disease activity at 2, 6, and 12 months after the switch. Secondary endpoints were subgroup analyses of patients with and without concomitant immunomodulators; changes in biomarkers, quality of life, drug trough levels and anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs); and adverse events.
A total of 313 IBD patients were switched (195 CD; 118 UC). There were no significant changes in clinical disease activity, quality of life, biomarkers (except a small but significant increase in albumin in CD) including F-calprotectin, drug trough levels, or proportion of patients in remission. Disease worsening rates were 14.0% for CD and 13.8% for UC; and 2.7% developed ADAbs and 2.2% developed serious adverse events.
This is the largest study of switched IBD patients published to date, and it demonstrates that switching from Remicade to CT-P13 may be done with preserved therapeutic effectiveness and safety in both CD and UC.

Abstract 88. Title: Systematic Review: Non-medical Switching of Infliximab to CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31970610
Abstract: Biosimilar approval, such as Inflectra™ (CT-P13) for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), has reduced direct drug costs. Though clinicians are comfortable with biosimilar use in treatment-naïve patients, there are concerns in some jurisdictions that there are insufficient data from well-controlled trials to support non-medical switching. A systematic review, along with a critical assessment of the study design, was conducted to assess the potential impact of switching stable CD/UC patients from infliximab to CT-P13.
A literature search using PubMed and abstracts/posters from 3 major gastroenterology conferences from 2014 to 2018 was completed. Two individual reviewers extracted data from each relevant report and compiled it into evidence tables to facilitate descriptive analyses. Key randomized trial and observational study designs were critically assessed to contextualize data relevance.
A total of 49 reports (3 randomized controlled trials, 40 observational trials, and 1 case series) were included. Most studies revealed no efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns with non-medical switch. Limitations of supporting data include a small number of randomized controlled trials; predominance of observational studies with varying outcome assessments and lack of appropriate controls; and scarcity of research on biosimilar switch long-term effects.
The majority of studies suggested non-medical switch is safe. However, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be aware of differences and limitations in study designs when making inferences about the risks and benefits of switching stable IBD patients to biosimilars.

Abstract 89. Title: Process and Clinical Outcomes of a Biosimilar Adoption Program with Infliximab-Dyyb.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223602
Abstract: In 2016, the FDA approved infliximab-dyyb (IFX-dyyb) as a biosimilar to infliximab (IFX). Deemed to have comparable efficacy and safety to IFX, IFX-dyyb is 20%-30% less expensive, allowing significant cost savings for institutions and some payers. In 2018, IFX was reported to be the drug with the highest spend since 2013, costing $3.8 billion; however, transition to IFX-dyyb would save $1.1 billion. Regardless, many institutions have not transitioned to IFX-dyyb or other IFX biosimilars (e.g., IFX-abda) because of concerns about clinical outcomes, uncertainty regarding financial impact, and barriers to operationalizing biosimilar adoption. At Boston Medical Center, a decision was made in March 2018 to adopt IFX-dyyb and transition patients who have been on IFX for ≥ 6 months for all indications to IFX-dyyb.
To (a) describe a biosimilar adoption process of IFX-dyyb in patients on IFX for ≥ 6 months; (b) characterize cost savings of transitioning patients to IFX-dyyb; and (c) evaluate real-world clinical outcomes of adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who transitioned to IFX-dyyb.
This is a retrospective cohort study of patients eligible for the IFX-dyyb switch from March 2018 to June 2019 at a large academic medical center. For process outcomes, we collected the proportion of patients who transitioned to IFX-dyyb and calculated the cost savings generated. To assess clinical outcomes of adult IBD patients who transitioned, we collected IFX and IFX-dyyb dosage, Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) or Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) scores, c-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and colonoscopy results. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar's test were used for statistical analyses.
Of 151 eligible patients, 146 (97%) successfully transitioned to IFX-dyyb. Based on our conversion rate to IFX-dyyb, our health system is forecasted to save approximately $500,000 annually. From March to June 2018, 63 of 75 (84%) eligible IBD patients transitioned from IFX to IFX-dyyb. In this cohort, of the 40 patients with HBI or SCCAI scores before and after transition, 36 (90%) maintained remission. For 32 patients, the mean CRP (SD) before transition was 11.2 (22) and 4.1 (4.8) after transition (<i>P</i> = 0.09). Since the IFX-dyyb transition, 9 patients had a colonoscopy, of which 5 (56%) were in endoscopic remission. As of October 2018, 56 (89%) patients continued with IFX-dyyb after transition. Of the 46 patients who had 12-15 months posttransition data, 38 (83%) remained on IFX-dyyb.
Implementation of a biosimilar adoption program can be successful and result in significant cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes. A model that uses actionable strategies and embraces collaboration among stakeholders is described here, with outcomes demonstrating successful IFX-dyyb uptake and no changes in clinical outcomes of transitioned adult patients with IBD.

Abstract 90. Title: Safety and efficacy of alternating treatment with EP2006, a filgrastim biosimilar, and reference filgrastim: a phase III, randomised, double-blind clinical study in the prevention of severe neutropenia in patients with breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
Publication Date: 2018-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29091995
Abstract: In 2015, the biosimilar filgrastim EP2006 became the first biosimilar approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for commercial use in the United States, marketed as Zarxio® (Sandoz). This phase III randomised, double-blind registration study in patients with breast cancer receiving (neo)adjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (TAC; docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) compares reference filgrastim, Neupogen® (Amgen), with two groups receiving alternating treatment with reference and biosimilar every other cycle.
A total of 218 patients receiving 5 µg/kg/day filgrastim over six chemotherapy cycles were randomised 1: 1: 1: 1 into four arms. Two arms received only one product, biosimilar or reference (unswitched), and two arms (switched) received alternating treatments every other cycle (biosimilar then reference or vice versa over six cycles). Since the switch occurred from cycle 2 onwards, this analysis compared pooled switched groups to the unswitched reference group for efficacy during cycles 2-6. Safety was also assessed. Non-inferiority in febrile neutropenia (FN) rates between groups for cycles 2-6 was shown if 95% were within a pre-defined margin of - 15%.
A total of 109 patients switched treatment, and 52 patients received reference in all cycles. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The incidence of FN was 0% (reference) versus 3.4% (n = 3, switched) across cycles 2-6, with a difference of - 3.4% (95% confidence interval: -9.65% to 4.96%), showing non-inferiority. Infections occurred in 9.3% (switched) versus 9.9% (reference). Hospitalisation due to FN was low (one patient in cycle 6; switched). Adverse events related to filgrastim were reported in 42.1% (switched) versus 39.2% (reference) (all cycles). Musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders related to filgrastim occurred in 35.5% (switched) versus 39.2% (reference) (all cycles), including bone pain (30.8% versus 33.3%). No neutralising antibodies were detected.
There were no clinically meaningful results regarding efficacy, safety or immunogenicity when switching from reference to biosimilar filgrastim/EP2006, or vice versa.

Abstract 91. Title: Infliximab Biosimilar (CT-P13; Infliximab-dyyb): A Review in Autoimmune Inflammatory Diseases.
Publication Date: 2016-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650650
Abstract: Infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13/infliximab-dyyb; Remsima<sup>®</sup>, Inflectra<sup>®</sup>) is approved in several countries for use in all indications for which reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Clinical data contributing to the EU approval of infliximab biosimilar were obtained from two pivotal double-blind clinical trials in patients with AS (PLANETAS) or RA (PLANETRA). Infliximab biosimilar demonstrated equivalence to reference infliximab in terms of its pharmacokinetic profile in patients with AS, patients with RA, and in healthy volunteers, and in terms of its efficacy in patients with RA. Clinical response rates in patients with RA or AS were maintained over the longer term (up to 102 weeks). In addition, the efficacy of infliximab biosimilar in patients with RA or Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [i.e. inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)] has been demonstrated in the real-world setting. Infliximab biosimilar was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of reference infliximab. Switching from reference infliximab to infliximab biosimilar had no detrimental effect on efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity compared with continuous infliximab biosimilar therapy, according to the extensions of PLANETAS and PLANETRA, and real-world data in IBD. Current evidence therefore suggests that infliximab biosimilar is a useful alternative to reference infliximab in patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases.

Abstract 92. Title: Transitioning from first- to second-generation biosimilars: An appraisal of regulatory and post-marketing challenges.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29108928
Abstract: Second-generation biosimilars (i.e. monoclonal antibodies or proteins generated by fusion of antibody and receptor moieties) differ in several respects as compared to first-generation ones (e.g. epoetins, bone marrow stimulating factors, somatotropins). In this respect, as second-generation biosimilars are endowed with much greater structural and molecular complexity, which might translate into a number of pharmacological and therapeutic issues, they raise new challenges for manufacturers and regulatory authorities as well as new concerns for clinicians. Based on these arguments, the present article was intended to review information on the main differences between first- and second-generation biosimilars for treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as their impact on immunogenicity, the design of clinical trials and the critical issue of extrapolation of therapeutic indications. The positions taken by relevant medical associations and the crucial role of pharmacovigilance are also reviewed. According to current knowledge, the initial post-marketing clinical experience with second-generation biosimilars is providing encouraging results, though their long-term safety and efficacy as well as the scientific basis underlying the extrapolation of therapeutic indications are still matter of discussion. There is some consensus that marketing applications should rely on studies supporting the clinical use of biosimilars in their different target diseases and patient populations. In parallel, clinical safety must be ensured by a strict control of the manufacturing processes and a solid pharmacovigilance program. It remains then a responsibility of the physician to drive a proper use of second-generation biosimilars into clinical practice, in accordance with guidelines issued by scientific societies.

Abstract 93. Title: Comparing Originator Biologics and Biosimilars: A Review of the Relevant Issues.
Publication Date: 2017-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28416374
Abstract: We provide a review of current knowledge on comparability between biosimilars and originator biologics in view of the continuous evolution occurring in this highly dynamic area.
English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE was explored, without time limits, to July 31, 2016, using the terms biosimilar, biotechnologic drug, biologic drug, monoclonal antibody, fusion protein, and anti-tumor necrosis factor. The reference lists of identified articles were examined carefully for additional pertinent publications.
Biological medicines are much more structurally complex and extremely sensitive to manufacturing conditions and therefore more difficult to characterize and produce than small molecule drugs. Even minor changes in manufacturing may lead to significant variations of the cellular systems used for biological production, as well as to differences in the structure, stability, or other quality aspects of the end product, all of which have the potential to affect tolerability and/or efficacy and increase the risk of immune responses. Owing to these issues, specific regulatory guidance on biosimilars is continuously evolving, and there is some disagreement on which studies need to be implemented to approve a biosimilar. According to current literature, the following points on biosimilars deserve consideration: biosimilar development is characterized by global harmonization, although several not fully answered questions remain regarding extrapolation of indications, switching or interchangeability, and tolerability; in patients with rheumatic diseases, the tolerability and efficacy of biosimilars in clinical practice remain to be established; several medical and patient associations have published position papers on biosimilars requesting that safety, efficacy, and traceability be carefully considered; long-term postmarketing studies should be implemented to allow physicians to gain confidence in biosimilars.
On the basis of current knowledge, and taking into consideration both regulatory rules and medical society positions, it can be concluded that, although cost savings are highly desirable, the approval process for biosimilars needs to place tolerability and efficacy, supported by scientifically sound evidence, as the highest priority. Moreover, physicians must retain full authority regarding the decision about which biopharmaceutical to use for treating patients.

Abstract 94. Title: Phase III randomized study of the proposed adalimumab biosimilar GP2017 in psoriasis: impact of multiple switches.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29917226
Abstract: Adalimumab is used to treat several inflammatory diseases, including plaque psoriasis. GP2017 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar.
To assess the impact of multiple switches between GP2017 and reference adalimumab (ref-ADMB) following the demonstration of equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity, in adult patients with active, clinically stable, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
This 51-week double-blinded, phase III study randomly assigned patients to GP2017 (n = 231) or ref-ADMB (n = 234) 80 mg subcutaneously at week 0, then 40 mg biweekly from week 1. At week 17, patients were rerandomized to switch (n = 126) or continue (n = 253) treatment. The primary end point was patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16, with equivalence confirmed if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in PASI 75 between treatments was ± 18%. The key secondary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in continuous PASI. Other end points were PASI over time; PASI 50, 75, 90 and100; pharmacokinetics; safety; tolerability and immunogenicity for the switched and continued treatment groups.
Equivalent efficacy between GP2017 and ref-ADMB was confirmed for the primary (66·8% and 65·0%, respectively; 95% CI -7·46 to 11·15) and key secondary end points (-60·7% and -61·5%, respectively; 95% CI -3·15 to 4·84). PASI improved over time and was similar between treatment groups at week 16, and the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. There were no relevant safety or immunogenicity differences between GP2017 and ref-ADMB at week 16, or the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. No hypersensitivity to adalimumab was reported upon switching.
Following the demonstration of GP2017 biosimilarity to ref-ADMB, switching up to four times between GP2017 and ref-ADMB had no detectable impact on efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.

Abstract 95. Title: Treatment with SDZ-ADL, an Adalimumab Biosimilar, in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, or Psoriatic Arthritis: Results of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures from Two Phase III Studies (ADMYRA and ADACCESS).
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33651341
Abstract: SDZ-ADL (GP2017; Sandoz GmbH, Austria) is an EMA-/FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilar. The effect of SDZ-ADL on quality of life (QoL) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) was assessed as part of two phase III studies, one in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (PsO; ADACCESS) and the other in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; ADMYRA). Additionally, ADACCESS included patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
ADACCESS included 465 patients with PsO, whereas ADMYRA included 353 patients with RA. Both studies evaluated and confirmed equivalent efficacy, similar safety, and immunogenicity of SDZ-ADL with reference adalimumab (ref-ADL). A third of patients underwent multiple (four) treatment switches between study treatments starting at Week 17 (ADACCESS); all patients switched from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL at Week 24 (ADMYRA). Assessed PROs included Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and EuroQol five-dimension health status questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in ADACCESS, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) score in ADMYRA, and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) in both studies.
In both studies, baseline scores for all PRO assessments were comparable between the two treatment groups. In ADACCESS, mean DLQI decreased from baseline in both groups, and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) percent reductions from baseline in DLQI were comparable between groups at Week 17 (SDZ-ADL, - 64.5 [80.3]; ref-ADL, - 70.6 [41.7]), which were sustained after the switch at Week 51 ('continued SDZ-ADL,' - 79.7 [36.2]; 'continued ref-ADL,' - 80.8 [44.6]; 'switched to SDZ-ADL,' - 70.7 [32.2]; 'switched to ref-ADL,' - 69.3 [49.6]). In ADACCESS, the proportion of patients with an EQ-5D-5L score of 1 (no problems) increased from baseline for all five dimensions in all treatment groups and was comparable between treatment groups at Week 51. In ADACCESS, in patients with PsA at baseline, mean (SD) HAQ-DI scores decreased from baseline in both treatment groups, and scores were comparable between groups at Week 17 (SDZ-ADL, 0.5 [0.6]; ref-ADL, 0.5 [0.6]) and after switching at Week 51 ('continued SDZ-ADL,' 0.4 [0.5]; 'continued ref-ADL,' 0.4 [0.6]; 'switched to SDZ-ADL,' 0.5 [0.8]; 'switched to ref-ADL,' 0.7 [0.6]). In ADMYRA, proportion of patients achieving HAQ-DI in the normal range (≤ 0.5) was comparable between treatment groups at Week 24 (SDZ-ADL, 37.8%; ref-ADL, 36.3%) and after switching at Week 48 ('SDZ-ADL,' 41.6%; 'ref-ADL/switched to SDZ-ADL,' 40.0%). In ADMYRA, mean FACIT-Fatigue scores increased from baseline in both treatment groups. At Week 24, mean (SD) percent change from baseline in the FACIT-Fatigue scores was 75.4 (135.5) in SDZ-ADL and 73.0 (96.3) in ref-ADL groups; the scores were sustained after switching at Week 48.
Treatment with SDZ-ADL and ref-ADL resulted in comparable improvements in PROs as well as QoL scores across the three diseases, PsO, PsA, and RA. Switching between SDZ-ADL and ref-ADL had no negative impact on PROs across the reported period. CLINICAL TRIALS.

Abstract 96. Title: Efficacy and safety of MYL-1501D versus insulin glargine in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Results of the INSTRIDE 3 phase 3 switch study.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691472
Abstract: To assess the efficacy, insulin dose, safety and immunogenicity when people with type 1 diabetes mellitus switched between MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine (Lantus®; Sanofi-Aventis US LLC, Bridgewater, New Jersey).
Eligible participants from INSTRIDE 1 who completed 52 weeks of reference insulin glargine treatment were randomized 1:1 to the reference sequence (n = 63; reference insulin glargine for 36 weeks) or to the treatment-switching sequence (n = 64; MYL-1501D [weeks 0-12], reference insulin glargine [weeks 12-24] and MYL-1501D [weeks 24-36]). Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 36 was the primary efficacy endpoint used to demonstrate equivalence between the two treatment sequences. Secondary endpoints included: change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin dose; immunogenicity; and adverse events, including hypoglycaemia.
Mean changes in HbA1c (least squares [LS] mean [SE]) from baseline to week 36 were -0.05 (0.032) and -0.06 (0.034) for the treatment-switching and reference sequences, respectively (LS mean difference 0.01 [95% CI -0.085 to 0.101]). Treatment sequences were comparable in terms of secondary endpoints, including FPG, SMBG and insulin dose, and the safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two sequences were similar.
Switching participants between MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine demonstrated equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity, showing that people taking reference insulin glargine can safely switch to MYL-1501D.

Abstract 97. Title: Biosimilar versus patented erythropoietins: learning from 5 years of European and Japanese experience.
Publication Date: 2015-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189295
Abstract: Patent expiries on leading biologics are creating new momentum in the market for biosimilars (copies of off-patent biologics), paving the way for their development. However, little is known about the factors influencing the competition between biosimilars and their reference products (REF).
The aim of this study was to analyse key global erythropoietin (EPO) markets and factors affecting biosimilar EPO (BIOSIM-EPO) uptakes, and to identify countries where BIOSIM-EPOs have gained significant market shares.
Inclusion criteria for countries in the study were a biosimilar regulatory framework similar to the EU framework, and biological market value higher than US$2.5 billion. Factors evaluated included EPO market size, EPO retail/hospital distribution mix, national incentives to use biosimilars and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences. IMS Health provided EPO consumption in volumes, values, and EPO ex-manufacturer prices from 2007 to 2012.
Japan: large-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (6.8 % in 2012). France: large-sized market, dominant retail distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (5.8 %). Spain and Italy: medium-sized market, dominant hospital distribution, no incentives, moderate BIOSIM-EPO uptakes (11.5 and 8.6 %). Germany: small-sized market, dominant retail distribution, presence of incentives, high BIOSIM-EPO uptake (30.4 %). UK: small-sized market, mixed retail/hospital distribution, no incentives, low BIOSIM-EPO uptake (2.0 %). BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences play no role at a global level (-10.8 % in Germany and -26.9 % in Japan).
EPO markets have proven to be highly country-specific. EPO market sizes, EPO retail/hospital distribution mixes and BIOSIM-EPO/REF price differences may not be determining factors of BIOSIM-EPO uptakes. Prescription and substitution incentives to use BIOSIM-EPO appear to be determining factors in Germany. The heterogeneity of national EPO markets makes it impossible to outline country profile types with significant BIOSIM-EPO penetrations.

Abstract 98. Title: Personalized medicine in rheumatoid arthritis: How immunogenicity impacts use of TNF inhibitors.
Publication Date: 2020-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32173513
Abstract: Up to 40% of patients treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) do not respond to therapy. Testing drug bioavailability and/or anti-drug antibody (ADAb) levels may justify dosage adjustment or switch to different drugs, enabling a personalized medicine approach. We report a multicenter cross-sectional study on different methods [ELISA and a cell based functional assay (reporter gene assay - RGA)] for drug/ADAb detection, and on the relationship between drug bioavailability and ADAb. 163 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with infliximab (IFX; n = 67), adalimumab (ADL; n = 49) or etanercept (ETA; n = 47) were tested for drug and ADAb levels. Furthermore, we report prospective data from additional 70 patients (59 RA and 11 juvenile idiopathic arthritis - JIA) tested for drug and ADAb levels at baseline (T0) and after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6) of treatment with ADL or ETA only. IFX-treated patients were not included because of the increasing use of IFX biosimilars. Stringent inclusion criteria were used in order to avoid unwanted variables in both studies; none of the patients used TNFi before the study, and TNFi was used only in combination with methotrexate. Clinical response was defined according to EULAR response criteria. The two assays performed comparably in the comparison study. Accordingly, ELISA was selected for the prospective study because of its feasibility in the clinical setting. The cross-sectional study found ADAb in IFX and ADL treated groups only, that were associated with a decrease in pharmacological drug availability in the blood. Comparable results were found for the ADL-treated group in the prospective study which also showed a relationship between drug/ADAb levels and the loss of clinical response. Altogether our findings support drug and anti-drug Ab monitoring in the real-world clinical setting thus enabling individualized treatment and reducing disability in chronic inflammatory arthritis.

Abstract 99. Title: Effectiveness of etanercept biosimilar SB4 in maintaining low disease activity in patients with psoriatic arthritis switched from etanercept originator: an open-label one year study.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30985223
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Currently, there are no studies specifically aimed at investigating the effectiveness of etanercept biosimilar SB4 in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).<b>Objectives:</b> Our primary objective was to verify the ability of SB4 to maintain low disease activity in patients switching from reference etanercept to SB4 after 1 year of treatment with this last drug.<b>Methods:</b> Eighty-seven PsA patients with low disease activity at baseline measured by using the clinical Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis ≤ 13 (cDAPSA; range 0-154) were prospectively evaluated after 6 and 12 months when switching from the reference etanercept to SB4.<b>Results:</b> One year after switching from the reference etanercept to SB4, 76 (87.3%) out of 87 patients maintained a cDAPSA ≤ 13.<b>Conclusions:</b> SB4 was effective in maintaining a state of low disease activity in the majority of patients switched from the reference etanercept. However, the proportion of patients (11 subjects) who failed to maintain a state of low disease activity at the end of the study was statistically significant. Loss of effectiveness in the above subjects was mainly due to subjective evaluations given by the patients, rather than an objectifiable exacerbation of disease.

Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31156245
Abstract: To evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the treatment with teberif/interferon β-1a, to analyze safety, tolerability and dynamics of key efficacy variables after switching from referent drug rebif to biosimilar teberif in patients with remitting multiple sclerosis (RMS).
During the main period of the international multicenter randomized study patients were randomized to receive treatment with teberif for 52 weeks, or rebif for 52 weeks, or placebo for 16 weeks to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatment. After the main study period, patients were group-independently switched to take open-label teberif treatment during the next 48 weeks.
The analysis of multiple evaluation parameters of the efficiency during the 1st study period (blinded) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> study period (open-label) has shown that teberif and rebif demonstrate equivalent efficacy and stable 2-year efficacy of teberif was proven. There were no significant differences between teberif and rebif for all safety, and tolerability parameters. Switching from rebif to teberif didn't influence treatment efficacy. The 2-year study results confirmed a biosimilar teberif's benign tolerability and expected safety profile to other interferons β-1a in patients with RMS.

Abstract 101. Title: From "blockbusters" to "biosimilars": an opportunity for patients, medical specialists and health care providers.
Publication Date: 2012-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23010202
Abstract: Advances in basic research and research and development plans of pharmaceutical companies are radically changing the kind of available drugs and therapeutic targets. We are switching from predominantly chemical molecules, aimed at treating large populations of patients (blockbuster drugs), to a new generation of products, mostly biotech, aimed at modifying a specific pathogenetic mechanism. In other word we are moving fast to targeted therapy, which represents the first step toward personalized therapy, where the right drug at the right dose is administered to the right person, at the right time. Like the patent expiration of chemical products has corresponded to the development of generic drugs, the expiration of new biotech products will witness the appearance of biosimilars. The latter are biologic products that are highly similar but not identical to the reference medical products in terms of quality, safety and efficacy. This implies specific research, clinical monitoring, physicians updating of knowledge for a safe and appropriate use of these products. We are the beginning of a devolution in patient's care and physicians' practice.

Abstract 102. Title: The safety of emerging biosimilar drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068848
Abstract: Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), often administered in combination with methotrexate, target specific inflammatory mediators and have transformed the treatment of rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also the spondyloarthritides. However, the high cost of these drugs in many countries restricts patient access. As many bDMARDs have reached or are near to patent expiration, numerous biosimilar drugs are in development and some have already been approved. Biosimilars are generally priced lower than their reference products (RPs), or bio-originators, and as prices come down it is hoped that patient access to these drugs will increase, making the safety of these drugs an area of major interest. Areas covered: This article reviews publicly available safety data on biosimilars in RA. Expert opinion: Most available data for biosimilars in RA relate to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody). As biosimilar use around the world increases, evidence supporting the clinical safety of the biosimilars compared with their RPs also grows. To date, no new safety concerns have been raised in studies with TNFi or rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of RA; safety profiles have been consistent with those of their RPs. However, careful post-marketing pharmacovigilance remains necessary.

Abstract 103. Title: Progress in biosimilar monoclonal antibody development: the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25713985
Abstract: Biosimilars are biologic medical products whose active drug substance is made by a living organism or derived from it. The term is used to describe a subsequent version of an innovator biopharmaceutical product aiming at approval following patent expiry on the reference product. Biosimilars of monoclonal need to demonstrate similar but not identical quality of nonclinical and clinical attributes. Not all data of the originator product need to be recapitulated, as large numbers of patient-years of exposure data are already available. Thus, biosimilar development is largely based on the safety profiles of the originator product. The evaluation of biosimilarity includes immunogenicity attributed risks. CT-P13 (Remsima™/Inflectra™, Celltrion/Hospira), a biosimilar of the innovator drug infliximab (INF), was the first approved complex biosimilar monoclonal antibody in the EU, within the framework of WHO, EMA and US FDA biosimilar guidelines. CT-P13 has shown analytical and nonclinical features highly similar to INF including pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of this article is to highlight the recent biosimilar development and to review the results from the studies PLANETRA and PLANETAS, which have supported the approval of CT-P13 for several indications.

Publication Date: 2016-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27117857
Abstract: CT-P13, the biosimilar of infliximab, has been recently approved in the EU, Australia, Canada, Japan and many other countries. Thus, it was the first biosimilar approved in the field of rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. Since there has been debate about the issue of switching from RMP to the biosimilar and some national societies have expressed concerns, this review was written with the following objectives: The review concludes that whilst prudent switching practices should be employed, growing safety experience accumulated thus far with CT-P13 and other biosimilars is favorable and does not raise any specific concerns.

Abstract 105. Title: [Revised version of the statement by the DGRh on biosimilars-update 2017].
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29383440
Abstract: The treatment of rheumatic diseases with bioloics has significantly improved the prognosis of patients. Currently, there are 13 preparations available in Germany for the treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. These original preparations generally have-depending on the individual country-15 years of patent protection. As soon as the patent has expired, approved biosimilars can be brought into use. For the approval of a biosimilar, authorities such as the European Medical Agency or the American Food and Drug Administration require proof of the best possible comparability with respect to efficacy and safety in comparison to the original or reference product. Since 2015, biosimilars of inifliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and rituximab have been granted approval in the European Union, the USA, Japan and in other countries. Further biosimilar products for these reference products are in development for treatment in rheumatology. From a societal and medical point of view, this opens up the possibility to increase the availability of biopharmaceutical products for patients through lower prices. In Germany, this possibility has already occurred-statutory health insurance physicians have introduced quotas for biosimilars, which will ultimately decrease spending and healthcare costs. This can lead to price reductions of the original products, which has already happened in Germany. Biosimilars can be prescribed for new patients or as a change from the original to the generic drug. When switching, a distinction is made between individual switching (interchangeability), which is made in individual consultation between the physician and the patient, and nonmedical switching (substitution) made at the societal or governmental level, which is made in the context of health care cost containment, and then, for example, implemented at the pharmacy level. Preliminary data from Norway and Denmark are available for substitution on the basis of results from large studies or registries in which systematic changes were made. The previous conclusion was that this does not lead to new problems for the patients. The German Society for Rheumatology recognizes the advantages of introducing biosimilars in Germany, but recommends that their use be based primarily on a joint decision by the treating physician and patient.

Abstract 106. Title: The switch from etanercept originator to SB4: data from a real-life experience on tolerability and persistence on treatment in joint inflammatory diseases.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33133246
Abstract: Switching from originator to biosimilar is part of current practice in inflammatory rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (iRMDs) such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondylarthritis (axSpA), with evidences derived from both etanercept (ETN) to SB4-switching randomized controlled trials and real-life registries. We investigated the safety and treatment persistence of ETN/SB4 in a multi-iRMD cohort derived from two rheumatology departments in our region.
Adult patients with iRMDs, treated with ETN for at least 6 months and switched to SB4 in stable clinical condition, were eligible for this retrospective evaluation. Retrospective data on adverse events, loss of efficacy and persistence on treatment were collected until latest available follow-up.
A total of 220 patients (85 RA, 81 PsA, 33 axSpA, 14 juvenile idiopathic arthritis and seven other conditions; 142 females, mean age 58 ± 7 years, disease duration 12 ± 4 years, ETN duration 7 ± 4 years) were enrolled, with median follow-up of 12.1 (9.7-15.8) months. A total of 50 patients (22.7%) presented with at least one adverse event, with 36 (16.4%) disease flares and 30 (13.6%: 11 for safety and 19 loss of efficacy) SB4 withdrawals. Cumulative SB4 treatment persistence was 99.1%, 88.6% and 64.6% at 6, 12 and 18 months respectively. Back-switch to ETN was performed in 17/30 cases, the remaining cases were managed with change of biologic disease modifying or conventional synthetic anti-rheumatic drug. Age was the only significant predictor of SB4 interruption at 6 months.
Our real-life data confirm the safety profile of switching from ETN to SB4, with slightly higher treatment persistence rates compared with other real-life registries.

Abstract 107. Title: Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33110013
Abstract: Over the past 2 decades, biological therapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor-α has become a cornerstone of treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although clinically effective, the biological therapies remain expensive, and their availability and utilization have been at times limited due to their high costs. Biosimilars are biological products similar to but not identical to the original biological agent or "reference biologic," also called "originator biologic." It is hoped that the use of biosimilars might enable these agents to become more available and, thus, decrease further expenditures related to the use of the original reference agents such as infliximab and adalimumab. In this study, we review the currently available evidence and shortcomings of these data supporting the use of biosimilars for the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including their efficacy and safety as related to initiating therapy with biosimilar agents or switching between reference and biosimilar biologic agents.

Abstract 108. Title: Switching from Remicade® to Remsima® is well Tolerated and Feasible: A Prospective, Open-label Study.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27660339
Abstract: A biosimilar version of infliximab [CT-P13/Remsima®] recently entered the European market. The clinical data on its use in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are sparse, especially on switching from the originator Remicade®. In this study, we aimed to prospectively investigate the feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of switching from Remicade to Remsima in a real-life IBD population.
All adult patients who were treated with Remicade in the Department of Gastroenterology at Oslo University Hospital were switched to Remsima. The follow-up lasted for 6 months. In addition, a retrospective registration was performed with a start time of 6 months before switching drugs. The primary endpoints were [i] the proportion of patients remaining on medication 6 months after switching and [ii] adverse events during the 6 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included [i] disease activity scores [Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Partial Mayo Score], C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval, and p-infliximab and [ii] the development of antidrug antibodies.
In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. The large majority [97%] remained on the medication throughout follow-up. A low number of adverse events were observed. No change in disease activity, C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval or p-infliximab was detected. Three patients developed new detectable antidrug antibodies.
Switching from Remicade to Remsima was feasible and with few adverse events, including very limited antidrug antibody formation and loss of response.

Abstract 109. Title: A Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Proposed Biosimilar ABP 798 With Rituximab Reference Product in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32627420
Abstract: ABP 798 is a proposed biosimilar to rituximab reference product (RP), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety results from the comparative clinical study that evaluated the PK, PD, safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of ABP 798 versus rituximab RP are presented here. Subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received 2 doses of ABP 798, United States-sourced RP (rituximab US) or European Union-sourced RP (rituximab EU), each consisting of two 1000-mg infusions 2 weeks apart. For the second dose (week 24), ABP 798- and rituximab EU-treated subjects received the same treatment; rituximab US-treated subjects transitioned to ABP 798. End points included area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity and maximum observed serum concentration following the second infusion of the first dose (PK) and percentage of subjects with complete CD19+ cell depletion days 1-33 (PD). Primary analysis established PK similarity between ABP 798 and rituximab RP based on 90% confidence intervals of the adjusted geometric mean ratios being within a prespecified equivalence margin of 0.8 and 1.25. Complete CD19+ B-cell depletion on day 3 among groups confirmed PD similarity. These findings demonstrated PK/PD similarity between ABP 798 and rituximab RP in subjects with moderate to severe RA.

Abstract 112. Title: Etanercept (SB4): A Review in Autoimmune Inflammatory Diseases.
Publication Date: 2016-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27455991
Abstract: Etanercept (SB4) [Benepali(®)], a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor that is a biosimilar of reference etanercept (Enbrel(®)), is approved in the EU for use in all adult indications for which reference etanercept is approved, namely rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis), psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis. The approval of etanercept (SB4) was based on the results of stringent comparability exercises designed to demonstrate similarity to reference etanercept in terms of quality, biological activity, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. In two well-designed clinical trials, etanercept (SB4) was equivalent to reference etanercept with regard to pharmacokinetic properties in healthy volunteers and in terms of efficacy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. Longer-term efficacy (up to 52 weeks) was also similar in both treatment groups. Etanercept (SB4) was generally well tolerated, with a similar safety profile to that of reference etanercept. Preliminary results of the open-label extension period (100 weeks) suggest that transitioning from reference etanercept to etanercept (SB4) was associated with sustained efficacy and no change in the adverse event profile or immunogenicity. In conclusion, etanercept (SB4) provides therapeutically equivalent alternative in adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases requiring treatment with etanercept.

Abstract 114. Title: Flares in rheumatoid arthritis: frequency and management. A report from the BRASS registry.
Publication Date: 2014-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334643
Abstract: To describe the frequency, duration, and management of flares as reported by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Data were collected in a prospective observational study of patients with RA recruited from a single academic center and treated according to the rheumatologists' discretion. Every 6 months, patients reported the number and duration of RA flares and described how these were managed in terms of adding or changing medication and use of nonpharmacologic strategies.
Of patients who reported flares at least once during the study, 74% reported having flares 6 months prior to study entry and 59% reported flares prior to the first 6-month visit. At subsequent visits, 54-57% reported having > 1 flare. Thirty percent of patients in remission reported flares. Flare duration lasted ≥ 2 weeks in 30%, 1-2 weeks in 13%, and < 1 week in 57%. Forty percent reported medication changes at the time of their flare; 16% changed medication and used nonpharmacologic strategies and 26% of patients reported no changes in treatment as a result of flares. Longer duration of flare was associated with changes in disease-modifying therapy.
Patients with RA experienced flares more often when noted to be in higher disease activity states than when in remission and reported changes in disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologics more frequently when flares were of longer duration. There is a need to prospectively study symptom intensity and duration of flare in relation to disease activity and consider self-management strategies in the development of a measure of flare.

Abstract 115. Title: The US approach to biosimilars: the long-awaited FDA approval pathway.
Publication Date: 2012-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030677
Abstract: In the US, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act, 2009) provided the pathway to create an abbreviated licensure procedure for biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed biologic product. In February 2012, the FDA issued three guidelines that list the requirements for biosimilar registration. The topics covered include scientific and quality considerations to demonstrate biosimilarity to a reference product and a guidance that clarifies the BPCI Act implementation. The sponsor application for the biosimilar approval must contain biosimilarity information based on data derived from analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Clinical studies should include an assessment of immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and address one or more indications licensed for the reference product. To demonstrate biosimilarity the applicant is allowed to use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-US-licensed product. According to these guidelines, the FDA will consider different aspects when evaluating biosimilarity, such as product formulation, complexity, and stability which will have a risk-based approach and will depend on the degree of knowledge of the product characteristics, as well as clinical experience with the reference one. The FDA intends to use a risk-based and facts-focused approach for review of applications of biosimilars, although it faces several challenges. Once a biologic medicine has been demonstrated to be biosimilar to the reference product, an abridged development program for the biosimilar medicine can be carried out in a similar way to that established by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, FDA legislation goes a step further than the EMA, offering the possibility to adopt full interchangeability for biosimilars.

Abstract 116. Title: A role for the Tgf-β/Bmp co-receptor Endoglin in the molecular oscillator that regulates the hair follicle cycle.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239775
Abstract: The hair follicle is a biological oscillator that alternates growth, regression, and rest phases driven by the sequential activation of the proliferation/differentiation programs of resident stem cell populations. The activation of hair follicle stem cell niches and subsequent entry into the growing phase is mainly regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signalling, while regression and resting phases are mainly regulated by Tgf-β/Bmp/Smad activity. A major question still unresolved is the nature of the molecular switch that dictates the coordinated transition between both signalling pathways. Here we have focused on the role of Endoglin (Eng), a key co-receptor for members of the Tgf-β/Bmp family of growth factors. Using an Eng haploinsufficient mouse model, we report that Eng is required to maintain a correct follicle cycling pattern and for an adequate stimulation of hair follicle stem cell niches. We further report that β-catenin binds to the Eng promoter depending on Bmp signalling. Moreover, we show that β-catenin interacts with Smad4 in a Bmp/Eng-dependent context and both proteins act synergistically to activate Eng promoter transcription. These observations point to the existence of a growth/rest switching mechanism in the hair follicle that is based on an Eng-dependent feedback cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and Bmp/Smad signals.

Abstract 117. Title: Biosimilars 101: considerations for U.S. oncologists in clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2014-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24810680
Abstract: Biosimilars of biologics used for cancer treatment and supportive care are expected to enter the U.S. market soon. Biosimilars will be highly similar to their reference products, but unlike generic drugs, not identical. Differences between a biosimilar and its reference product may arise because of the complexity of biologics, and differences in the cell lines and processes used during manufacturing. Biosimilars will be approved in the United States through a regulatory pathway based on comparative analytical and clinical studies for their characterization and demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences from their reference products. Unlike generics, initial approval may not include interchangeability, as additional evidence may be required before a biosimilar could be approved as interchangeable with its reference product; interchangeable designation could allow pharmacy-level substitution without prescriber intervention. In some cases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may extrapolate an indication that has not been formally investigated for the biosimilar but that is approved for the reference product. Robust safety monitoring of all biologics is important to track and accurately attribute adverse events, particularly because their inherent complexity and manufacturing differences make them susceptible to structural changes that can affect safety (e.g., immunogenicity). Accuracy of postapproval safety reports will partly depend on the biosimilar naming approach. Potential cost savings should be evaluated in the context of differences in manufacturers' patient-assistance programs, copayments, and institutional costs. A manufacturer's ability to ensure reliable supply of high-quality biosimilars should also be considered. Broad understanding of these issues is critical for oncologists preparing for their use in clinical practice.

Abstract 118. Title: Safety and efficacy of rituximab biosimilar (CT-P10) in systemic sclerosis: an Italian multicentre study.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32413118
Abstract: Recent data have shown a significant efficacy of rituximab (RTX) in SSc. An RTX biosimilar (RTX-B) is a more affordable option. We assessed the safety and efficacy of an RTX-B (CT-P10) in SSc.
SSc patients treated with RTX-B with at least 6 months of follow-up were retrospectively identified from six Italian referral centres. SSc patients naïve to RTX-B (RTX-Bn) or already treated with RTX originator and switched to an RTX-B (RTX-Bs) were evaluated. A comprehensive assessment of disease characteristics and organ involvement at baseline and after 6 months was obtained.
Thirty-three SSc patients were selected: 29 (87.9%) females, mean age 51.6 years (s.d. 14.2), mean disease duration 9.8 years (s.d. 8.1); 21 (64.5%) with dcSSc, 20 (60.1%) anti-topoisomerase I, 7 (21.2%) anti-RNA polymerase III and 6 (18.2%) anti-centromere positive. Seventeen (51.5%) were RTX-Bn and 16 were on RTX-Bs (48.5%). RTX was introduced because of skin progression in 18 patients (54.5%), interstitial lung disease (ILD) worsening in 11 (33.3%) and arthritis in 12 (36.4%). All patients were previously treated with immunosuppressants. At RTX-B introduction, 21 (63.6%) patients were on concomitant immunosuppressants: 15 (71.4%) on MMF and 6 (28.6%) on MTX. Twenty-three (69.7%) were on low-dose steroids. After 6 months, a significant reduction of the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), 28-joint DAS and CRP was observed (P = 0.002, 0.005 and 0.008, respectively); the mRSS significantly improved both in RTX-Bn (P < 0.024) and RTX-Bs patients (P < 0.031). No significant changes were observed for lung function tests, either in the entire cohort or in the subgroup of ILD patients. Only one RTX-Bs patient experienced transient neutropenia.
Our data suggest that RTX-B can represent a cheaper option in SSc patients, as it is effective in improving skin and joint involvement and in stabilizing lung function.

Abstract 119. Title: Focus on biosimilar etanercept - bioequivalence and interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30214149
Abstract: The recent approval of reference etanercept (re-ETN) biosimilars SB4, GP2015, and HD203 produced relevant changes in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis due to the considerably lower cost of these products and the consequent savings.
To review the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of ETN biosimilars when employed as first-line therapy or after transition from re-ETN. Patients' acceptability was also addressed.
The available literature was reviewed through a search of PubMed database, and abstract books of the American College for Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings. SB4, GP2015, and HD203 were licensed by the US, European and South Korea regulatory agencies after the bioequivalence to re-ETN was demonstrated through pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, and randomized, head to head, controlled trials. Based on the evidence of efficacy and safety of SB4 and HD203 in RA, and of GP2015 in psoriasis, by the extrapolation principle, the three biosimilars were approved for all indications licensed for re-ETN, and the regulatory agencies introduced the interchangeability from the originator to the biosimilar. Extrapolation of indications, and particularly interchangeability raised relevant concerns among the rheumatologists due to the low level of evidence supporting the switching strategy (or transition). Rheumatologists' concerns are oriented toward the relevant number of biosimilar discontinuations after the transition ranging from 7%-17% over a short-term follow-up period. As resulted from two studies, at least 20%-30% of the patients claimed more exhaustive information on the switching procedure.
Based on the available evidence, re-ETN biosimilars may be a good option as first-line therapy, while further data are needed to definitively establish the efficacy, safety, and the economic reflexes of transitioning from re-ETN.

Abstract 120. Title: Rapid loss of efficacy of biosimilar infliximab in three patients with Behçet's disease after switching from infliximab originator.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29308287
Abstract: Three patients affected by Behçet's disease (BD) with severe uveitis and neurological involvement in stable clinical remission and who rapidly relapsed after switching from reference infliximab (re-IFX) to biosimilar infliximab (bio-IFX) are reported. In order to observe the rules of local health authorities, two males and one female (38, 26, and 40 years old, respectively) with BD complicated by severe uveitis and neuro-Behçet and who were in prolonged remission, were switched from re-IFX to bio-IFX, with the same dosing regimen of 5 mg/kg intravenous infusions every 8 weeks. All three patients experienced disease flare-ups, with recurrence of uveoretinitis in the first patient, neuro-Behçet in the second, and uveitis and neuro-Behçet in the third after 1, 3, and 2 infusions, respectively. After appropriate washout of re-IFX, all three patients were administered subcutaneous adalimumab, with a dosing regimen of 40 mg/fortnight, and a good response was achieved. Our three patients with BD experienced a rapid disease relapse after switching from re-IFX to bio-IFX, possibly due to cross-reaction of anti-IFX antibodies. This outcome suggests the necessity to exercise caution regarding the automatic substitution of re-IFX with bio-IFX in patients achieving remission with re-IFX.

Abstract 121. Title: Biological and nonbiological complex drugs for multiple sclerosis in Latin America: regulations and risk management.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25924772
Abstract: Biological drugs and nonbiological complex drugs with expired patents are followed by biosimilars and follow-on drugs that are supposedly similar and comparable with the reference product in terms of quality, safety and efficacy. Unlike simple molecules that can be copied and reproduced, biosimilars and follow-on complex drugs are heterogeneous and need specific regulations from health and pharmacovigilance agencies. A panel of 14 Latin American experts on multiple sclerosis from nine different countries met to discuss the recommendations regarding biosimilars and follow-on complex drugs for treating multiple sclerosis. Specific measures relating to manufacturing, therapeutic equivalence assessment and pharmacovigilance reports need to be implemented before commercialization. Physical, chemical, biological and immunogenic characterizations of the new product need to be available before clinical trials start. The new product must maintain the same immunogenicity as the original. Automatic substitution of biological and complex drugs poses unacceptable risks to the patient.

Abstract 122. Title: Biosimilar Drugs for Psoriasis: Principles, Present, and Near Future.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29549597
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, lifelong disease with a high prevalence (afflicting approximately 1-5% of the population worldwide) and is associated with significant morbidity. The introduction of biologic therapies has improved the management of this disease. Multiple biologic medicines that block cytokine signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) and inhibitors of interleukin (IL)-17 (brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab), IL-23 (guselkumab), or IL-12/23 (ustekinumab), are approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Despite the clinical benefits associated with use of biologics in psoriasis, many patients are not treated with biologic therapy, and access to treatment may be limited for various reasons, such as high treatment costs. Patents for many biologics have expired or will soon expire, and biosimilar versions of these agents are available or in development. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved biologic (i.e., originator or reference) product, and has no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency when compared with the reference product. Biosimilars may offer less expensive treatment options for patients with psoriasis; they also may increase access to and address problems with underutilization of biologic therapy. Biosimilar development and approval follows a well-regulated process in many countries, with guidelines developed by the European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, and World Health Organization. Currently, several anti-TNF biosimilars are available for use in patients with psoriasis, and other monoclonal antibodies are in development. This review provides dermatologists and those who treat and/or manage psoriasis with a working knowledge of the scientific principles of biosimilar development and approval. It also examines real-world experience with biosimilars available for or used in dermatology that will enable physicians to make informed treatment decisions for their patients with psoriasis.

Abstract 123. Title: The Budget Impact of Introducing Tildrakizumab to a United States Health Plan for Managing Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219733
Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the budget impact of introducing tildrakizumab for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis from a US health plan perspective.
A budget impact model estimated costs before and after the adoption of tildrakizumab to a hypothetical US health plan with 1 million covered lives over 5 years. Additionally, the model included adalimumab, brodalumab, etanercept, guselkumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, ustekinumab, and apremilast; biosimilars were not included. Model input data were obtained from the published literature, clinical trials, and prescription data. Market uptake for tildrakizumab was assumed as 1% annually over 5 years. Patients initiating or switching treatments required induction dosing; all others treated required maintenance dosing. The model compared the total annual costs for tildrakizumab versus treatment without tildrakizumab to calculate budget impact in 2018 US dollars. Scenarios exploring alternative assumptions for adverse events and market uptake rates were assessed, and a one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted.
Within a health plan of 1 million members with an estimated 1048 patients receiving biologics or apremilast for psoriasis, the total annual health plan cost after introducing tildrakizumab decreased by $5585, $137,025, $205,538, $274,051, and $342,563 in years 1-5, respectively, resulting in a cumulative reduction of $964,763 over 5 years. The impact on total cost was largely due to drug acquisition costs. The incremental per member per month (PMPM) cost reductions were negligible in year 1, $0.01 in year 2, $0.02 in years 3-4, and $0.03 in year 5. Scenario and sensitivity analyses confirmed the model robustness.
The introduction of tildrakizumab with a 1% annual uptake over 5 years has the potential to reduce the cost of treating patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for a US health plan.

Abstract 124. Title: Similar names for similar biologics.
Publication Date: 2014-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25001080
Abstract: Approval of the first biosimilar in the USA may occur by the end of 2014, yet a naming approach for biosimilars has not been determined. Biosimilars are highly similar to their biologic reference product but are not identical to it, because of their structural complexity and variations in manufacturing processes among companies. There is a need for a naming approach that can distinguish a biosimilar from its reference product and other biosimilars and ensure accurate tracing of adverse events (AEs) to the administered product. In contrast, generic small-molecule drugs are identical to their reference product and, therefore, share the same nonproprietary name. Clinical trials required to demonstrate biosimilarity for approval may not detect rare AEs or those occurring after prolonged use, and the incidence of such events may differ between a biosimilar and its reference product. The need for precise biologic identification is further underscored by the possibility of biosimilar interchangeability, a US designation that will allow substitution without prescriber intervention. For several biologics, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has used a naming approach that adds a prefix to a common root nonproprietary name, enabling healthcare providers to distinguish between products, avoid medication errors, and facilitate pharmacovigilance. We recommend that the FDA implement a biosimilars naming policy that likewise would add a distinguishable prefix or suffix to the root nonproprietary name of the reference product. This approach would ensure that a biosimilar could be distinguished from its reference product and other biosimilars in patient records and pharmacovigilance databases/reports, facilitating accurate attribution of AEs.

Abstract 125. Title: Barriers towards effective pharmacovigilance systems of biosimilars in rheumatology: A Latin American survey.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148288
Abstract: This review summarises the current status of regulatory guidelines for the approval of biosimilars in Latin America and highlights the main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in this region. We also report results from a survey of Latin American rheumatologists assessing their understanding of prescribing biosimilars and the pharmacovigilance of these drugs.
We reviewed the current guidelines for the regulatory approval of biosimilars and barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in Latin American countries. Rheumatologists attending the II Pan-American League of Rheumatology Associations PANLAR Review Course (Biosimilars update) in Lima, Peru were asked to complete a short survey to determine their knowledge of biosimilars.
Many Latin American countries continue to lag behind Europe and the United States in establishing regulatory guidance and effective pharmacovigilance systems for biosimilars. Results from our survey also highlight a lack of awareness regarding the availability of biosimilars, their nomenclature, automatic substitution, and reporting adverse drug reactions because of these drugs.
The main barriers to effective pharmacovigilance in Latin America are the lack of consensus on the interchangeability of reference biologics and biosimilars, and the need for more suitably trained personnel to carry out effective postmarketing pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Inconsistencies in biosimilar nomenclature make it difficult to adequately trace drugs and record adverse drug reactions associated with their use, creating a barrier to the global pharmacovigilance of biologics.

Abstract 126. Title: Assessing biosimilar education needs among oncology pharmacy practitioners worldwide: An ISOPP membership survey.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268832
Abstract: The International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners (ISOPP) Biosimilar Task Force was charged to develop educational resources to address the learning needs related to biosimilars use of oncology pharmacy practitioners. To facilitate the process, the task force conducted a survey in order to identify unmet education needs as well as barriers for obtaining biosimilar education among oncology pharmacy practitioners.
A cross sectional survey was conducted between 10 December 2018 and 18 February 2019. Members of International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners and national oncology pharmacy groups were invited to complete the survey. The survey contained 22 items and consisted of four sections. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the survey results.
A total of 363 International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members were surveyed, with 75 members providing a response (response rate = 21%). In addition, 11 non-International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members also participated in the survey, bringing the total to 86 respondents. The top three areas in which respondents reported learning needs included evaluating comparative efficacy of a biosimilar to an originator’s product (74.4%), managing the switchover to a biosimilar from the original product (74.4%), and understanding medication safety issues in relation to biosimilars use (73.3%). The most common challenges faced in obtaining education on biosimilars included limited financial support for education on biosimilar products (38.4%), heavy workload (31.4%), and inadequate educational resources (27.9%).
This survey has identified numerous biosimilar learning needs as well as challenges faced in obtaining biosimilars education among oncology pharmacy practitioners. Educational activities should be created to address these learning needs, and innovative strategies should be considered to overcome practitioner’s barriers in obtaining biosimilars education.

Abstract 127. Title: FDA Expectations for Demonstrating Interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29714562
Abstract: There is a great interest from global companies who are developing biosimilars to pursue interchangeability designation for commercialization of their products in the US. An interchangeability designation will not only allow the substitutability at the pharmacy level without the intervention of a health care provider but the first sponsor who is able to garner interchangeability designation will also receive 12 months of marketing exclusivity. This paper will highlight our current understanding of FDA expectations with regards to demonstrating interchangeability.

Abstract 128. Title: Extrapolation and Interchangeability of Infliximab and Adalimumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28164249
Abstract: Infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars have been approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency and have already been introduced to the international market. Availability into the US market is imminent. Biosimilars are highly similar to the reference biologic product but should not be referred to as, nor equated with, generic medications as no two biosimilars can ever be identical. Regulatory pathways for biosimilar approval consider the totality of evidence for biosimilar approvals, but the preponderance of development relies on analytic and functional testing and allows extrapolation between indications to reduce the financial burden of completing comparative clinical trials for each indication. Neither CT-P13 (infliximab biosimilar) nor ABP 501 (adalimumab biosimilar) was clinically tested in patients with inflammatory bowel disease prior to being submitted for approval by regulatory agencies. The body of available evidence suggests that these drugs will perform similarly to their originators. The pathway for interchangeability of biosimilars has yet to be clarified by federal regulators and currently remains determined by states within the USA. However, preliminary data suggests that switching from originator to biosimilar is safe with minimal differences in clinical efficacy.

Abstract 129. Title: The Role of Biosimilars in Patient Access to Therapeutic Antibodies for Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29189136
Abstract: Biosimilars have the potential to create competition, lower costs, and increase patient access to biological medications. However, biological medications are sensitive to their manufacturing processes and difficult to precisely characterize, leading to questions about substitution and interchangeability among products.
This article reviews the role of biosimilars in patient access to therapeutic antibodies.
Although pathways for the approval of biosimilars have been developed, important issues remain unresolved. Interchangeability, or the designation of one medicine as clinically similar to and/or substitutable for another, is specified in some countries but restricted or awaiting policy resolution in others. Non-medical switching, or the switching among biological medications to select a less expensive product, for reasons unrelated to patient health and safety, is controversial because of the potential for complications related to repeated switching (e.g., immunogenicity and loss of therapeutic effect), and transfer of prescribing responsibility for patient medications from the physician to the insurance company. Although biosimilars have different names in different countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for nomenclature that incorporates the international nonproprietary name of the original biological medication followed by a distinguishing suffix qualifier. Naming consistency across countries seems sensible, and adoption of the WHO recommended suffix would greatly simplify pharmacovigilance.
Support for the WHO proposal is advised by numerous stakeholders, and resolution of the remaining outstanding issues is urged so that patients and physicians can safely access biosimilars.

Abstract: To investigate healthcare professionals' knowledge and attitudes towards infliximab and insulin glargine biosimilars and the factors influencing their prescribing. Then, to compare healthcare professionals' attitudes with the utilisation of these biosimilars in UK hospitals.
Self-administered, one-time web-based survey and drug utilisation analysis.
Professional associations and societies in the field of dermatology, diabetology, gastroenterology and rheumatology in the UK, between 8 August 2016 and 8 January 2017. The volume of utilisation of branded and biosimilar infliximab and insulin glargine in UK hospitals was derived from the DEFINE database, between 2015 and 2016.
Participants' knowledge and awareness of biosimilars and factors influencing their use and corresponding usage of infliximab and insulin glargine biosimilars.
Responses were obtained from 234 healthcare professionals across dermatology, diabetology, gastroenterology and rheumatology specialties. 75% of respondents were aware that biosimilars were available on their local formulary. 77% of respondents considered biosimilars extremely or very important to save costs for the NHS. Gastroenterologists had the highest utilisation of infliximab biosimilars (14%) in 2015 rising to (62%) in 2016. Healthcare professionals had greater concerns about safety and efficacy when switching patients to biosimilars than when starting biosimilars in biological naïve patients. Guidance from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and robust pharmacovigilance studies on biosimilars were both considered important factors in increasing biosimilars use.
British healthcare professionals are well informed about biosimilars with high level of awareness. Safety and efficacy concerns were higher in switching than in initiating biosimilars among some prescribers. It is probable that personal experience of biologics as well as discipline-specific guidance influenced prescribers' responses.

Abstract 131. Title: Patient Perspectives on Switching from Infliximab to Infliximab-dyyb in Patients with Rheumatologic Diseases in the United States.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31777780
Abstract: The introduction of biosimilars for rheumatologic diseases (RDs) has provided a potentially lower-cost therapy compared with their bio-originator products; however, adoption of biosimilars may be challenged by patient perceptions. The objective of this study was to describe patients' perspectives of switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb.
This was a survey of adult patients with RDs who qualified for switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb therapy between September 1 2017 and January 31 2018. Verbal consent was obtained prior to administration of a telephone survey. Survey questions were focused on the safety, efficacy, and knowledge of biosimilar therapy.
A total of 108 patients were identified with 52 (48%) patients consenting to study participation. Forty (77%) and 12 (23%) patients reported switching and not switching, respectively, to infliximab-dyyb. Regarding disease control, most respondents (80%) were satisfied to very satisfied with the switch to infliximab-dyyb. Major concerns reported for switching included not knowing enough about the medication (38%), potential side effects (35%), and loss of disease activity control (35%).
Overall, patients reported satisfaction with switching from infliximab to infliximab-dyyb, but concerns regarding safety and efficacy were expressed. Patient involvement in the switching decision-making process may allay concerns and enhance biosimilar uptake.

Published English-language studies of any size or design that compared the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse events, or immunogenicity of a biosimilar TNF-α inhibitor with a reference biologic in humans.
Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from selected studies, and assessed study quality.
Of 19 eligible studies, 8 were phase 1 randomized trials, 5 were phase 3 randomized trials, and 6 were observational studies. Most phase 1 trials (n = 7) involved healthy volunteers, phase 3 trials involved patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and observational studies involved those with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. All phase 1 trials showed that pharmacokinetic parameters of the biosimilar and respective biologic were within the prespecified equivalence margin of 80% to 125%. Phase 3 trials suggested similar clinical responses and adverse events. Adverse events were usually of mild to moderate severity. Two cross-sectional observational studies showed cross-reactivity between products, whereas 4 cohort studies of patients switched from reference to biosimilar products suggested similar efficacy and safety outcomes.
Possible publication bias, small sample sizes of many studies, and lack of published studies for several biosimilars.
Preliminary evidence supports the biosimilarity and interchangeability of biosimilar and reference TNF-α inhibitors.

Abstract 134. Title: On hybrid parallel-crossover designs for assessing drug interchangeability of biosimilar products.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28026996
Abstract: In recent years, a specific hybrid parallel-crossover design that consists of two sequences of treatments, namely R-R-R-R and R-T-R-T, where T and R is a proposed biosimilar product and an innovative biological product, respectively, have been proposed and received much attention for assessing drug interchangeability between T and R, where R could be either a US-licensed product or an EU-reference product. In practice, there are three types of hybrid parallel-crossover designs that are commonly employed in assessing drug interchangeability of biosimilar products. These three types of parallel-crossover hybrid designs include (1) a parallel + 2 × 2 crossover design, (2) a parallel + 2 × 3 crossover design, and (3) a parallel + 2 × 4 crossover design. This article provides a comprehensive review of these study designs including a complete N-of-1 randomized trial design. A specific hybrid parallel-crossover design, that is, (RRRR, RTRT) for addressing drug interchangeability in terms of switching and the relative risk between with/without alternation is discussed.

Abstract 135. Title: Design and Analysis of Biosimilar Switching Studies.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31933227
Abstract: Under the US Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI), the development of biosimilar (test) products provides affordable alternatives to innovative biological (reference) products for the general patient population. However, in practice, as the number of biosimilar products available on the market increases, whether these biosimilars can be used interchangeably is a concern. Thus, using switching studies to evaluate the risk of reduced efficacy and increased safety concerns with and without switch(es) in the development of biosimilar products is of interest. For this purpose, the US FDA, in its recent draft guidance on interchangeability, suggested using a 2 × 2 crossover design (RT, RR) to evaluate a single switch and (RTR, RRR) and (RTRT, RRRR) to evaluate multiple switches. In this article, we examine the statistical properties, analyses, and sample size requirements of these switching study designs. We also investigate the relative efficiencies of these switching designs compared with the complete  n-of-1 trial design.

Abstract 136. Title: Some thoughts on drug interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2016-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26366703
Abstract: Current regulation for generic approval is based on the assessment of average bioequivalence. As indicated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an approved generic drug can be used as a substitute for the innovative drug. FDA does not indicate that two generic copies of the same innovative drug can be used interchangeably even though they are bioequivalent to the same brand-name drug. In practice, bioequivalence between generic copies of an innovative drug is not required. However, as more generic drug products become available, it is a concern whether the approved generic drug products have the same quality and therapeutic effect as the brand-name drug product and whether they can be used safely and interchangeably. In this article, several criteria including a newly proposed criterion for assessing drug interchangeability are studied. In addition, comments on possible study designs and power calculation for sample size under a specific design are also discussed.

Abstract 137. Title: Scientific considerations for assessing biosimilar products.
Publication Date: 2013-Feb-10
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22933240
Abstract: The problem for assessing biosimilarity and drug interchangeability of follow-on biologics (biosimilar products) is studied. Unlike the generic products, the development of biosimilar products is much more complicated because of fundamental differences in functional structures and manufacturing processes. As a result, the criteria and standard methods for the design and analysis of bioequivalence assessment of generic drug products may not be directly applicable to assessing biosimilarity of biosimilar products. In this article, we provide some scientific considerations for criteria, design, and analysis regarding the assessment of biosimilarity and drug interchangeability of biosimilar products. In addition, we discuss scientific and practical issues raised at the 2010 FDA public hearing and the 2011 FDA public meeting on biosimilar products.

Publication Date: 2013-Feb-10
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22899372
Abstract: Unlike traditional small molecule (chemical) drug products, the development of biologic products is very different and variable with respect to the manufacturing process and environmental factors such as light and temperature. The complexity and heterogeneity of the molecular structure, complicated manufacturing process, different analytical methods, and possibility of severe immunogenicity reactions make quantitative evaluation of follow-on biologics a great challenge to both scientific community and regulatory agencies. In this article, we propose a general approach for development of a biosimilarity index based on the concept of reproducibility probability for quantitative evaluation of biosimilarity and interchangeability. The proposed method is robust regardless the biosimilarity criteria used and/or study design employed.

As biologics differ from small-molecule drugs due to their size and complexity, multifaceted manufacturing process, and their potential for immunogenicity, biosimilars cannot be considered "generic versions" of currently approved biologics. In highly regulated markets, biosimilars can be authorized only if they are demonstrated to be highly similar to the original drug from an analytical and clinical perspective. Any differences must be justified and shown to have no clinically meaningful effect on the safety and efficacy of the biosimilar. The European Medicines Agency has approved a number of biosimilars and the recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab monoclonal antibody is another regulatory milestone. This article will provide context regarding key safety issues addressed in biosimilar development, approval, and delivery, as well as inform oncologists on matters of safety to consider when prescribing biosimilars. Pertinent issues about safety from countries or regions where biosimilars are currently in use also will be reviewed.

Abstract 140. Title: Biosimilars: The US Regulatory Framework.
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-14
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27813877
Abstract: With the passage of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration established an abbreviated pathway for developing and licensing biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory framework and the technical requirements of the US biosimilars program involve a stepwise approach that relies heavily on analytical methods to demonstrate through a "totality of the evidence" that a proposed product is biosimilar to its reference product. By integrating analytical, pharmacological, and clinical data, each of which has limitations, a high level of confidence can be reached regarding clinical performance. Although questions and concerns about the biosimilars pathway remain and may slow uptake, a robust scientific program has been put in place. With three biosimilars already licensed and numerous development programs under way, clinicians can expect to see many new biosimilars come onto the US market in the coming decade. [Note added in proof: Since the writing of this article, a fourth biosimilar has been approved.].

Abstract 141. Title: Assessment of effectiveness and safety of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in a real-life setting for treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439591
Abstract: To assess the effectiveness and safety of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, administered in a real-life setting to adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
This multi-center, non-interventional, observational study was conducted in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Romania. A total of 151 patients with severe active RA (n = 81) or AS (n = 70) were enrolled and treated with CT-P13 for 24 weeks, according to current medical recommendations. Effectiveness was assessed using the 4-item Disease Activity Score 28 with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) for RA patients, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) for AS patients. Safety was assessed by withdrawals and adverse events (AEs).
A total of 129 patients (RA: 67; AS: 62) were included in the effectiveness analysis. CT-P13 treatment significantly improved DAS28-CRP scores at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints) in patients with RA and BASDAI scores at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints) in patients with AS. CRP levels were significantly reduced at 12 and 24 weeks (p = .0001 vs baseline for both timepoints). Among 713 infusions, 34 AEs were reported (4.8% of infusions), of which 11 were considered related to CT-P13 treatment. Two of seven serious AEs were considered possibly (hepatocellular injury) or definitely (dyspnoea due to allergic infusion reaction) treatment-related. Eight patients discontinued CT-P13 due to AEs and four patients were withdrawn due to therapeutic failure.
CT-P13 was effective and safe in a real-life setting in patients with active RA or AS.

Abstract 142. Title: Overview of Humira® Biosimilars: Current European Landscape and Future Implications.
Publication Date: 2021-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33556387
Abstract: Humira® (adalimumab) by AbbVie has been the top-selling biologic drug product for the last few years - reaching nearly $20 billion in annual sales in 2018. Upon the October 2018 release of four adalimumab biosimilars into the European market, those sales began to shrink. By the end of 2019, the annual sales of Humira®, albeit still high, dipped closer to $19 billion as nearly 35% of European patients had been switched from Humira® to a biosimilar. Diminishing sales are expected to continue as the adoption of adalimumab biosimilars increases in Europe and Humira®'s patent protection is lost in the United States come 2023. In this review we discuss how impactful the availability of biosimilars has been to the European adalimumab market approximately two years after their release. We further analyze the marketed biosimilars with regards to differences in their formulation, delivery devices, biological activity, physicochemical properties, clinical trials data, and current financial foothold. More importantly, though, we highlight how "similar" these biosimilars are to Humira®. In doing so, we seek to educate the public on what they may be able to expect once adalimumab biosimilars enter the United States market in 2023.

Abstract 143. Title: Awareness, Knowledge, and Perceptions of Biosimilars Among Specialty Physicians.
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27798772
Abstract: The Biosimilars Forum conducted a survey through an independent organization from November 20, 2015 to January 4, 2016 in order to assess current levels of awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of biosimilars among US specialty physicians who already prescribe biologics. The survey was intended to provide a baseline level of knowledge about biosimilars and will be repeated in 2-3 years in order to monitor trends over time.
A 19-question survey was created by the Biosimilars Forum and was administered by an independent third party.
Responses were obtained from 1201 US physicians across specialties that are high prescribers of biologics, including dermatologists, gastroenterologists, hematologist-oncologists, medical oncologists, nephrologists, and rheumatologists.
The results of this survey highlight a significant need for evidence-based education about biosimilars for physicians across specialties. Five major knowledge gaps were identified: defining biologics, biosimilars, and biosimilarity; understanding the approval process and the use of "totality of evidence" to evaluate biosimilars; understanding that the safety and immunogenicity of a biosimilar are comparable to the originator biologic; understanding the rationale for extrapolation of indications; and defining interchangeability and the related rules regarding pharmacy-level substitution.

Abstract 144. Title: Switching Reference Medicines to Biosimilars: A Systematic Literature Review of Clinical Outcomes.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29500555
Abstract: To evaluate the possibility that switching from reference biologic medicines to biosimilars could lead to altered clinical outcomes, including enhanced immunogenicity, compromised safety, or diminished efficacy for patients, a systematic literature review was conducted of all switching studies between related biologics (including biosimilars).
A systematic search was conducted using the Medline<sup>®</sup> and Embase<sup>®</sup> databases up to 30 June 2017 employing specific medical subject heading terms. Additionally, the snowball method and a hand search were also applied. Publications were considered if they contained efficacy or safety information related to a switch from a reference medicine to a biosimilar. Non-English, non-human studies, editorials, notes, and short surveys were excluded.
Primary data were available from 90 studies that enrolled 14,225 unique individuals. They included protein medicines used in supportive care as well as those used as therapeutic agents. The medicines contained seven different molecular entities that were used to treat 14 diseases. The great majority of the publications did not report differences in immunogenicity, safety, or efficacy. The nature and intensity of safety signals reported after switching from reference medicines to biosimilars were the same as those already known from continued use of the reference medicines alone. Three large multiple switch studies with different biosimilars did not show differences in efficacy or safety after multiple switches between reference medicine and biosimilar. Two publications reported a loss of efficacy or increased dropout rates.
While use of each biologic must be assessed individually, these results provide reassurance to healthcare professionals and the public that the risk of immunogenicity-related safety concerns or diminished efficacy is unchanged after switching from a reference biologic to a biosimilar medicine.

Abstract 145. Title: Biosimilars: implications for rheumatoid arthritis therapy.
Publication Date: 2017-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28306596
Abstract: Abbreviated pathways for the approval of biosimilars have been established in the European Union (EU), the United States, and other countries. Biosimilar TNF inhibitors have been available in South Korea and the EU since 2012 and 2013, respectively, and the first biosimilar infliximab was introduced to the clinic in the United States in November 2016. Five TNF inhibitor biosimilars have now been approved, and many other biosimilars to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases are in development.
Over the last 18 months, published results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of biosimilars with their reference products. 'Real world' experience with biosimilars in the EU continues to increase and provides evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of using biosimilars in the clinic and of switching from bio-originators to their biosimilars.
Cost implications of using biosimilars and extrapolation of their use to treat diseases in which they were not tested in RCTs are of great interest. We review the results of RCTs and available experience with biosimilars in the clinic.

Abstract 147. Title: An open-label extension study to demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy of ABP 501 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-29
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30922373
Abstract: ABP 501 was evaluated in a phase 3 single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) study to collect additional safety and efficacy data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Subjects completing the final visit in the parent phase 3 randomized, double-blind, controlled equivalence study comparing the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar ABP 501 with adalimumab reference product (RP) were enrolled in this open-label extension (OLE) study. All subjects received 40 mg ABP 501 every other week for 68 weeks. Key safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and anti-drug antibody (ADA) incidences. Efficacy endpoints included ACR20 (at least 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology core set measurements from baseline) and Disease Activity Score 28-joint count C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) change from baseline.
Among 466/467 patients treated with ABP 501, 229 transitioned from the ABP 501 arm of the parent study (ABP 501/ABP 501) and 237 from the adalimumab RP arm (RP/ABP 501); 412/467 (88.2%) patients completed the study. The overall TEAE incidence was 63.7% (297/466); grade ≥ 3 TEAE incidence was 9.0% (42/466). The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product was 3.6% (17/466). The SAE incidence was 9.9% (46/466). Overall, 18.2% (85/466) of subjects developed binding ADAs and 6.9% (32/466) developed neutralizing ADAs in the OLE study. The ACR20 response rate was 73.3% (340/464 subjects) at OLE baseline, and 78.8% (327/415 subjects) at week 70 of the OLE study. The overall mean DAS28-CRP change from the parent study baseline was - 2.25 at the OLE study baseline (n = 440), - 2.36 at week 4 (n = 463), - 2.41 at week 24 (n = 450), - 2.55 at week 48 (n = 433), and - 2.60 at week 70 (n = 412). Efficacy was maintained throughout the study.
Efficacy previously demonstrated in the parent study was maintained in this OLE study with no new safety findings. Long-term safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy were similar in the ABP 501/ABP 501 and RP/ABP 501 groups. The single switch from RP to ABP 501 did not impact immunogenicity.

Abstract 148. Title: Extension Study of PF-05280586, a Potential Rituximab Biosimilar, Versus Rituximab in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Publication Date: 2018-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29692005
Abstract: This extension study provided continued treatment to subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who had participated for ≥16 weeks in a pharmacokinetic similarity study of PF-05280586 (potential rituximab biosimilar). Objectives were to evaluate overall pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of PF-05280586 after transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586, and follow-up of biomarker and efficacy assessments.
Subjects were offered ≤3 additional courses of treatment of PF-05280586, with or without a single transition from rituximab in Europe (rituximab-EU; MabThera) or the US (rituximab-US; Rituxan) to PF-05280586. Each course comprised 2 intravenous infusions (1,000 mg on days 1 and 15, separated by 24 weeks [± 8 weeks]).
Of 220 subjects in the parent study, 185 were randomized and included in this study. There were no notable differences in drug concentrations between groups or across courses, with little variation in depletion of CD19+ B cells between groups, and no apparent relationship between infusion-related reactions and antidrug antibodies with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586. Long-term safety and tolerability of PF-05280586 was acceptable in all groups for up to 96 weeks, with a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events independent of single drug transition. The percentage of subjects with a low disease activity score and disease activity score remission was similar across groups for all time points, and responses were sustained until end of study.
This study demonstrated acceptable safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF-05280586, without increased immunogenicity on single transition.

Abstract 149. Title: Long-term Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of the Infliximab (IFX) Biosimilar, PF-06438179/GP1111, in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis After Switching from Reference IFX or Continuing Biosimilar Therapy: Week 54-78 Data From a Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31939063
Abstract: Our objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the infliximab biosimilar, PF-06438179/GP1111 (PF-SZ-IFX), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who continued biosimilar treatment throughout 78 weeks or who switched from reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) sourced from the EU (IFX-EU) at week 30 or week 54 in the REFLECTIONS B537-02 study.
In this phase III, double-blind, active-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA were initially randomized to PF-SZ-IFX or IFX-EU, each with methotrexate (treatment period [TP] 1; N = 650). At week 30, patients receiving PF-SZ-IFX continued PF-SZ-IFX; patients receiving IFX-EU were re-randomized to continue IFX-EU or switch to PF-SZ-IFX (TP2; n = 566). From weeks 54 to 78, all patients received open-label treatment with PF-SZ-IFX (TP3; n = 505). Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity data were analyzed during TP3.
Efficacy was sustained and comparable across groups at week 78, with American College of Rheumatology criteria for ≥ 20% clinical improvement response rates of 75.9% (biosimilar group), 77.8% (week 30 switch group), and 68.3% (week 54 switch group). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 28.9%, 29.4%, and 30.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients who were antidrug antibody (ADA) positive and neutralizing antibody positive (as a percentage of ADA-positive patients) was stable and comparable between groups.
Results to week 78 continue to support the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PF-SZ-IFX in patients with moderate-to-severe active RA. There were no clinically meaningful differences between groups, independent of a single treatment transition from IFX-EU to PF-SZ-IFX at week 30 or week 54.

Abstract 150. Title: Certolizumab pegol and secukinumab for treating active psoriatic arthritis following inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic review and economic evaluation.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28976302
Abstract: Several biologic therapies are approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). NICE does not specifically recommend switching from one biologic to another, and only ustekinumab (UST; STELARA<sup>®</sup>, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) is recommended after anti-tumour necrosis factor failure. Secukinumab (SEC; COSENTYX<sup>®</sup>, Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) and certolizumab pegol (CZP; CIMZIA<sup>®</sup>, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) have not previously been appraised by NICE.
To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CZP and SEC for treating active PsA in adults in whom DMARDs have been inadequately effective.
Systematic review and economic model.
Fourteen databases (including MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched for relevant studies from inception to April 2016 for CZP and SEC studies; update searches were run to identify new comparator studies.
Clinical effectiveness data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were synthesised using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) methods to investigate the relative efficacy of SEC and CZP compared with comparator therapies. A de novo model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SEC and CZP compared with the other relevant comparators. The model was specified for three subpopulations, in accordance with the NICE scope (patients who have taken one prior DMARD, patients who have taken two or more prior DMARDs and biologic-experienced patients). The models were further classified according to the level of concomitant psoriasis.
Nineteen eligible RCTs were included in the systematic review of short-term efficacy. Most studies were well conducted and were rated as being at low risk of bias. Trials of SEC and CZP demonstrated clinically important efficacy in all key clinical outcomes. At 3 months, patients taking 150 mg of SEC [relative risk (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.55 to 15.43] or CZP (RR 3.29, 95% CI 1.94 to 5.56) were more likely to be responders than patients taking placebo. The NMA results for the biologic-naive subpopulations indicated that the effectiveness of SEC and CZP relative to other biologics and each other was uncertain. Limited data were available for the biologic-experienced subpopulation. Longer-term evidence suggested that these newer biologics reduced disease progression, with the benefits being similar to those seen for older biologics. The de novo model generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three subpopulations and three psoriasis subgroups. In subpopulation 1 (biologic-naive patients who had taken one prior DMARD), CZP was the optimal treatment in the moderate-severe psoriasis subgroup and 150 mg of SEC was optimal in the subgroups of patients with mild-moderate psoriasis or no concomitant psoriasis. In subpopulation 2 (biologic-naive patients who had taken two or more prior DMARDs), etanercept (ETN; ENBREL<sup>®</sup>, Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) is likely to be the optimal treatment in all subgroups. The ICERs for SEC and CZP versus best supportive care are in the region of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In subpopulation 3 (biologic-experienced patients or patients in whom biologics are contraindicated), UST is likely to be the optimal treatment (ICERs are in the region of £21,000-27,000 per QALY). The optimal treatment in subpopulation 2 was sensitive to the choice of evidence synthesis model. In subpopulations 2 and 3, results were sensitive to the algorithm for Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index costs. The optimal treatment is not sensitive to the use of biosimilar prices for ETN and infliximab (REMICADE<sup>®</sup>, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Kenilworth, NJ, USA).
SEC and CZP may be an effective use of NHS resources, depending on the subpopulation and subgroup of psoriasis severity. There are a number of limitations to this assessment, driven mainly by data availability.
Trials are needed to inform effectiveness of biologics in biologic-experienced populations.

Abstract 151. Title: The economic pressures for biosimilar drug use in cancer medicine.
Publication Date: 2012-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22249658
Abstract: The main rationale for using biosimilar drugs is for cost saving. The market development for biosimilar drugs will therefore depend on the degree to which cost saving measures are required by nations, medical insurers and individuals and the absolute savings that could be gained by switching from original drugs. This paper is designed to discover the degree to which financial constraints will drive future health spending and to discover if legal or safety issues could impact on any trend. A structured literature search was performed for papers and documents to 27 August 2011. Where multiple sources of data were available on a topic, data from papers and reports by multinational or national bodies were used in preference to data from regions or individual hospitals. Almost all health systems face current significant cost pressures. The twin driver of increasing cancer prevalence as populations age and cancer medicine costs rising faster than inflation places oncology as the most significant single cost problem. For some countries, this is predicted to make medicine unaffordable within a decade. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a cost-control measure. Biosimilar introduction into the EU has already forced prices down, both the price of biosimilar drugs and competitive price reductions in originator drugs. Compound annual growth rates of use have been predicted at 65.8% per year. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a major cost-control measure. Only legal blocks and safety concerns are likely to act against this trend. For centralised healthcare systems, and those with a strong tradition of generic medicine use, biosimilar use will clearly rise with predictions of more than 80% of prescriptions of some biologic drugs within 1 year of market entry in the USA. Delaying the implementation of such programmes however risks a real crisis in healthcare delivery for many countries and hospitals that few can now afford.

Abstract: In the last decade, discussions on the development of the regulatory framework of generic versions of complex drugs such as biologicals and non-biological complex drugs have attracted broad attention. The terminology used is far from harmonized and can lead to multiple interpretations of legal texts, reflection papers, and guidance documents regarding market introduction as well as reimbursement. This article describes the meaning of relevant terms in different global regions (Europe, USA, WHO) and offers a proposal for a globally accepted terminology regarding (non-) biological complex drugs.

Abstract 153. Title: Potential Cost Implications of Mandatory Non-Medical Switching Policies for Biologics for Rheumatic Conditions and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32909249
Abstract: In 2018, TNFα inhibitors were the highest cost drug class for Canadian public drug programs. In 2019, two Canadian provinces announced mandatory nonmedical switching policies in an attempt to reduce their costs by increasing biosimilar uptake. The national impact of similar policies across Canada is unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of monthly publicly funded prescription claims for infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab between June 2015 and December 2019. We reported the market share of biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept in 2019 for each province and estimated the cost savings that public payers could have realized in 2019 if mandatory switching policies had been implemented across Canada, including a sensitivity analysis, which assumed that governments receive a 25% rebate on all biologics. Provincial drug programs spent CAD $991.84 million on infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 2019, and, when biosimilars were available, they constituted only 15.5% of national utilization of these drugs. In British Columbia, the implementation of a mandatory switching policy for patients with rheumatic conditions increased the biosimilar market share of infliximab and etanercept by 299% (from 19.7% to 78.5%). If applied nationwide to all three biologics for all indications, we estimate such policies could lead to annual savings of between CAD $179.71 million and CAD $425.64 million nationally. The overall market share of biosimilars remains low in all provinces where mandatory switching policies have not been introduced. The cost implications of successfully increasing biosimilar uptake would be substantial, particularly as more biosimilars reach the Canadian market.

Abstract 154. Title: Integrating trastuzumab biosimilars and HER2-directed therapies into HER2-positive breast cancer management.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32282173
Abstract: The approval of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in 1998 changed the trajectory of treatment and subsequent outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and is now the standard of care in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. However, as with most biologic drugs, trastuzumab comes with a relatively high price tag compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and contributes to healthcare budgets. Three engineered products related to trastuzumab-2 antibody-drug conjugates, ado-trastuzumab emtansine and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, as well as the subcutaneous trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-have since been approved and have expanded the treatment options for this patient population. The approval of 5 trastuzumab biosimilars as of the end of 2019 holds the promise of considerable cost savings, but challenges to integrating their use into patient care must be addressed. Barriers to their use, including physician uncertainty to switch patients from the reference drug to the therapeutic biosimilar and patients' lack of understanding about biosimilars, are common in the United States. It is also important that all stakeholders, including managed care professionals, pharmacists, and practice administrators, understand how to incorporate trastuzumab biosimilars into formulary discussions, clinical care plans and processes, and educational initiatives for healthcare providers and patients.

Abstract 155. Title: Switching from originator recombinant growth hormone (Genotropin™) to biosimilar (CRISCY™): Results from a 6-month, multicentric, non-inferiority, extension trial.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33260063
Abstract: A previous 12-month comparative trial with Criscy™ (r-hGH Cristália), a biosimilar recombinant growth hormone, demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety to Genotropin™. This extension trial evaluated the effects of switching patients treated with Genotropin™ to the biosimilar Criscy™ over an additional 6-month treatment period, comparing efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity parameters with patients remaining in the Criscy™ arm.
This extension study included 11 research centers and 81 patients who participated in the CERES study (Czepielewski et al., 2019 [1]). Participants from the Genotropin™ arm (n = 39) had the drug replaced by Criscy™ and the remaining participants were kept in the Criscy™ arm (n = 42) for an additional 6-month period to evaluate immunogenicity, efficacy (growth rate, height SDS), and safety (laboratory tests, and adverse events).
Before the switch, both Criscy™ and Genotropin groups were similar concerning demographics, and auxological measures: age, sex, height, height SDS, weight, and BMI. Height velocity (HV) after 18 months of treatment was 8.7 ± 1.56 cm/year for Criscy™ group and 8.9 ± 1.36 cm/year for Genotropin™ group in the ITT population (p = 0.43). The auxological parameters and IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 SDS were comparable between both groups of patients. No participants were excluded from the study due to adverse events. There were no clinical or statistical relevant differences between the treatment groups concerning frequency, distribution, intensity, and AEs outcome. Similarly, no new anti-r-hGH (ADA) cases among patients that switched from Genotropin™ to Criscy™ were reported. No neutralizing antibody (nAb) was detected in either group.
This trial showed that switching from originator recombinant human growth hormone to Criscy™ had no impact on efficacy, safety, nor immunogenicity as compared to continued treatment with Criscy™. Growth rates and ADA incidence remained the same as seen before the switch.

Abstract 156. Title: Nocebo effect and biosimilars in inflammatory bowel diseases: what's new and what's next?
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857634
Abstract: The use of biosimilars for the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) showed to be a valid strategy to reduce the economic burden of biologics on health-care costs and to increase patient access to treatment. However, the nocebo effect constitutes an important limitation to the wide use of biosimilars.
We conducted a literature overview to summarize information on nocebo effect in IBD population and to provide physicians with practical key strategies to prevent the nocebo effect in daily clinical practice and to improve patients' outcomes.
Despite the proven efficacy and safety of biosimilars, further clinical studies are needed to define the effects of reverse and multiple switches in the management of patients with IBD. The development of new subcutaneous formulations, better accepted by patients, could contribute to reduce patients' negative expectations, and limit the nocebo effect.

Publication Date: 2016-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26728875
Abstract: The acceptability of switching between reference drugs and their biosimilars is often disputed. It is unclear whether this concern is specific to the use of biosimilars or is relevant to the practice of switching between any biological drugs.
The objective of this study was to quantify the occurrence of switching between different erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted in the Umbria region (Italy). The study population included all residents who received their first epoetin prescription between 1 July 2011 and 31 December 2014. The Umbria drug prescription database and the regional archive of residents were used to gather information. Switching was defined as any transition between different epoetins (different substances and/or different products of the same substance) in a series of two prescriptions. The probability of switching was described in relationship to the duration of treatment in a survival analysis.
Overall, 3258 subjects received prescriptions of epoetins. Among the 2896 patients with at least two prescriptions, 354 (12.2%) experienced one or more switches. The probability of switching depended on the duration of treatment: approximately 15% of users switched within 12 months of observation and 25% switched within 2 years. Switching was not limited to reference and biosimilar epoetins and it affected patent and off-patent epoetins equally.
Switching between different epoetins was related to the duration of use and most episodes of switching involved epoetins that have never been contrasted in a comparability exercise. The present level of switching may provide reassurance to physicians when taken together with other sources of comparative evidence.

Abstract 158. Title: Future directions in inflammatory bowel disease management.
Publication Date: 2014-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24742736
Abstract: Clinical management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), new treatment modalities and the potential impact of personalised medicine remain topics of intense interest as our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD expands.
Potential future strategies for IBD management are discussed, based on recent preclinical and clinical research.
A top-down approach to medical therapy is increasingly being adopted for patients with risk factors for severe inflammation or an unfavourable disease course in an attempt to halt the inflammatory process as early as possible, prevent complications and induce mucosal healing. In the future, biological therapies for IBD are likely to be used more selectively based on personalised benefit/risk assessment, determined through reliable biomarkers and tissue signatures, and will probably be optimised throughout the course of treatment. Biologics with different mechanisms of action will be available; when one drug fails, patients will be able to switch to another and even combination biologics may become a reality. The role of biotherapeutic products that are similar to currently licensed biologics in terms of quality, safety and efficacy - i.e. biosimilars - is at an early stage and requires further experience. Other therapeutic strategies may involve manipulation of the microbiome using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, diet and combinations of all these approaches. Faecal microbiota transplantation is also a potential option in IBD although controlled data are lacking.
The future of classifying, prognosticating and managing IBD involves an outcomes-based approach to identify biomarkers reflecting various biological processes that can be matched with clinically important endpoints.

Abstract 159. Title: Review of the treatment of psoriatic arthritis with biological agents: choice of drug for initial therapy and switch therapy for non-responders.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28280401
Abstract: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease with a broad clinical spectrum and variable course. It can involve musculoskeletal structures as well as skin, nails, eyes, and gut. The management of PsA has changed tremendously in the last decade, thanks to an earlier diagnosis, an advancement in pharmacological therapies, and a wider application of a multidisciplinary approach. The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA. No evidence-based strategies are currently available for guiding the rheumatologist to prescribe biological drugs. Several international and national recommendation sets are currently available with the aim to help rheumatologists in everyday clinical practice management of PsA patients treated with biological therapy. Since no specific biological agent has been demonstrated to be more effective than others, the drug choice should be made according to the available safety data, the presence of extra-articular manifestations, the patient's preferences (e.g., administration route), and the drug price. However, future studies directly comparing different biological drugs and assessing the efficacy of treatment strategies specific for PsA are urgently needed.

Abstract 160. Title: 2017 recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology for the pharmacological treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2018-May-24
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30657071
Abstract: The objective of this document is to provide a comprehensive update of the recommendations of Brazilian Society of Rheumatology on drug treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), based on a systematic literature review and on the opinion of a panel of rheumatologists. Four general principles and eleven recommendations were approved. General principles: RA treatment should (1) preferably consist of a multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a rheumatologist, (2) include counseling on lifestyle habits, strict control of comorbidities, and updates of the vaccination record, (3) be based on decisions shared by the patient and the physician after clarification about the disease and the available therapeutic options; (4) the goal is sustained clinical remission or, when this is not feasible, low disease activity. Recommendations: (1) the first line of treatment should be a csDMARD, started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is established; (2) methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice csDMARD; (3) the combination of two or more csDMARDs, including MTX, may be used as the first line of treatment; (4) after failure of first-line therapy with MTX, the therapeutic strategies include combining MTX with another csDMARD (leflunomide), with two csDMARDs (hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine), or switching MTX for another csDMARD (leflunomide or sulfasalazine) alone; (5) after failure of two schemes with csDMARDs, a bDMARD may be preferably used or, alternatively a tsDMARD, preferably combined, in both cases, with a csDMARD; (6) the different bDMARDs in combination with MTX have similar efficacy, and therefore, the therapeutic choice should take into account the peculiarities of each drug in terms of safety and cost; (7) the combination of a bDMARD and MTX is preferred over the use of a bDMARD alone; (8) in case of failure of an initial treatment scheme with a bDMARD, a scheme with another bDMARD can be used; in cases of failure with a TNFi, a second bDMARD of the same class or with another mechanism of action is effective and safe; (9) tofacitinib can be used to treat RA after failure of bDMARD; (10) corticosteroids, preferably at low doses for the shortest possible time, should be considered during periods of disease activity, and the risk-benefit ratio should also be considered; (11) reducing or spacing out bDMARD doses is possible in patients in sustained remission.

Abstract 161. Title: Biosimilars in IBD: from theory to practice.
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27729659
Abstract: Biologic agents have revolutionized the care management of many life-threatening and debilitating diseases. As patents for older biologic therapies have begun to expire, the market has opened to copy versions of the originators - commonly referred to as biosimilars, follow-on biologic agents or subsequent-entry biologic agents - which are expected to gain a portion of the market, reduce health-care spending and increase treatment access worldwide. Importantly for patients with IBD, CT-P13 was the first biosimilar to infliximab that obtained regulatory approval by the European Medicines Agency in September 2013 and by the FDA in April 2016. In May 2016, SB2 was the second biosimilar to infliximab receiving marketing authorization in Europe. Currently, >20 other biosimilars to infliximab and adalimumab are in the development pipeline. Their similar-but-not-identical nature, and the concept of extrapolating efficacy and safety data from one therapeutic indication to another, seem to be confusing to physicians and cause concerns about the efficacy and safety of biosimilar products. A relevant debate is still ongoing in the field of IBD. This Review discusses the scientific principles underlying the biosimilar concept established in Europe and the USA, and discusses the current state of knowledge on biosimilar use in IBD.

Abstract 162. Title: Anti-TNF Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Searching the Proper Patient's Profile.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756565
Abstract: Biosimilars of infliximab (CT-P13) are currently approved and available for the same indications as for the originator. Some concerns about safety and immunogenicity have risen in the past because of lack of data in IBD. Since 2015, several cohort studies have been conducted in IBD showing that CT-P13 has comparable safety and efficacy profile to the originator, both in adult and pediatric population, either in naïve patients or even in those who switched from the originator to CT-P13. This review aims to analyze the current literature data in order to define a clear patient profile, to identify those IBD patients who would benefit the most from the use of CT-P13.

Abstract 163. Title: Viewpoint: knowledge and viewpoints on biosimilar monoclonal antibodies among members of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization.
Publication Date: 2014-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25008477
Abstract: Recently, two infliximab biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been approved by the European Medical Agency for all immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current knowledge regarding biosimilars among gastroenterologists and in particular among IBD specialists is unknown. Therefore we developed a web survey to evaluate the awareness of biosimilar mAb among IBD specialists and their readiness to use these therapies.
A 15-question multiple choice anonymous web survey was conducted with the logistic support of ECCO, with questions covering the most relevant aspects on biosimilars. Randomly selected ECCO members were invited by e-mail to participate. A descriptive analysis of responses was performed and analyzed.

Abstract 164. Title: Changes in Biosimilar Knowledge among European Crohn's Colitis Organization [ECCO] Members: An Updated Survey.
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27112706
Abstract: In 2013, a ECCO survey showed that a minority of IBD specialists was aware and confident about the benefits and issues of biosimilars. We aimed to look at the evolution of IBD specialists' thinking about biosimilars one year after they had become available in the European Union.
A 14-question anonymous survey was posted on the ECCO website. Members voluntarily responded in response to ECCO office invitations to participate in their surveys. Information on gender, job position, country, and experience with biologics also were collected.
Out of the 118 responders, only 17% of responders had no access to biosimilars. Most responders regarded cost-sparing [92.4%] as the main advantage of biosimilars, considered immunogenicity [69%] to be their main concern, and estimated that post-marketing pharmacovigilance, well-designed randomized clinical trials and further studies of risk profile were needed [30.5%, 27%, 32.2%, respectively, a 30-40% reduction since 2013]. Only 35% of physicians think biosimilars should carry distinct International Nonproprietary Names, as compared with 66% in 2013, and 89.8% disagreed with automatic substitution of the originator with a biosimilar by a pharmacist. The originator and biosimilar were considered interchangeable by 44.4% of responders, as compared with 6% in 2013. Only 32.2% were against the extrapolation across indications, and only 25% would not extrapolate data across IBD. Finally, only 19.5% felt little or no confidence in the use of biosimilars, as compared with 63% in 2013.
IBD specialists are generally well informed and educated about biosimilars. Compared with in 2013, there are now fewer concerns and more confidence about their use in clinical practice.

Abstract 165. Title: ECCO position statement: the use of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Publication Date: 2013-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23623738
Abstract: Biologics have become key agents for the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biosimilars are biological medicines similar to previously authorized biologics and are already available in some countries. This ECCO Position Statement defines the collective view of European specialist in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) concerning biosimilars. Biosimilars are not comparable to generic small molecules, since both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that can have profound effects on clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials in IBD, post-marketing pharmacoviligance, and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar should be requirements before approval. Switching from an established biologic to a biosimilar to save costs is likely to be as inappropriate and inefecctive as switching between current biologics that act on the same target, except when there is loss of response.

Abstract 166. Title: Biologic agents for IBD: practical insights.
Publication Date: 2015-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26284562
Abstract: Six biologic agents are currently approved for the treatment of IBD: four anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab pegol) and two anti-integrin agents (natalizumab and vedolizumab). In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis refractory to standard medications, treatment choice among available biologic agents can be challenging. Several parameters should be taken into account to help physicians through the decision-making process, including the comparative effectiveness and long-term safety profile, availability and labelling in the prescriber's country, international guidelines, and cost, as well as patient preferences (such as the route of administration). Herein, we provide practical insights on the use of biologic agents in IBD. The results of head-to-head trials between biologic agents are eagerly awaited to guide decision-making regarding the choice of first-line biologic agents and to determine whether switching within the same drug class or swapping (switching out of the drug class) is preferable after primary or secondary loss of response to the first biologic agent. In the near future, treatment algorithms might evolve with the launch of new drugs (such as ustekinumab, tofacitinib and etrolizumab) and the increased use of biosimilars.

Abstract 167. Title: The infliximab biosimilar in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2016-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473452
Abstract: The infliximab originator's patent recently expired, leading to the production of biosimilar versions of the drug. The biosimilars' efficacy was not tested on patients with psoriasis but most regulatory authorities approved their use in psoriasis because of an extrapolation of data from studies conducted in other diseases.
We sought to describe the use of the infliximab biosimilar (Remsima; CT-P13) in patients with psoriasis.
Objective (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and subjective (visual analog pain scale) measurements of disease activity were collected in 2 cohorts of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: cohort 1 patients switched from the infliximab originator to the infliximab biosimilar; and cohort 2 patients were infliximab-naïve and started on the infliximab biosimilar.
We observed no changes of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and visual analog pain scale scores in 30 patients who switched from the infliximab originator to the biosimilar. Four of 5 infliximab-naïve patients who started infliximab biosimilar treatment achieved 75% improvement or better from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score at the end of the induction phase.
Number of patients and length of follow-up was limited.
Patients with psoriasis taking infliximab originator treatment can switch to the infliximab biosimilar without experiencing a significant change in clinical response or additional adverse events. The use of the infliximab biosimilar could reduce the growing pressure on health care budgets.

Abstract 168. Title: Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy position paper on biosimilar medicines.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29959844
Abstract: Biological medicines nowadays have a great impact, as they offer treatment for  diverse diseases and suppose a high cost for health system. Biosimilar medicines contain a version of an active substance already authorized as an original  biotechnological medicine, whose patent has expired, and they comply with the  guidelines published by the European Medicines Agency. These guidelines, where biosimilarity criteria are established, guarantee comparability between biosimilar product and reference one. Biosimilars' authorization is carried out through a  centralized procedure based on clinical, non-clinical and quality studies. These  studies allow the extrapolation of indications, frequently, without carrying out additional analyses. In several European countries, switching between  original and biosimilar medicine is considered safe. In Spain, Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee of hospitals, as consensus bodies among health professionals, are the most suitable bodies to establish the  interchangeability criteria in each center. Biosimilar drugs contribute to  sustainability and to improvement of the accessibility to medicines. Faced with  this situation, Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy considers interesting to  express its position about biosimilar medicines' strategies. Spanish Society of  Hospital Pharmacy, in September 2015, published an information note about biosimilar medicines, in which its role as medicines similar in quality,  safety and efficacy to the originals, but at lower cost, was highlighted. Likewise, it was stressed the role of hospital pharmacists within the Pharmacy  and Therapeutic Committee of hospitals, where their knowledge for the  selection, evaluation and use of medicines could be useful, in coordination and permanent collaboration with other units or clinical services of hospitals.

Abstract 169. Title: Biosimilars in psoriasis: Clinical practice and regulatory perspectives in Latin America.
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27461455
Abstract: Latin American countries view biosimilar agents as an effective approach to curtail health-care expenditures while maintaining the safety and efficacy profile of their branded innovator comparators. To understand the complexities of the regulatory landscape and key therapeutic issues for use of biosimilars to treat moderate to severe psoriasis in Latin America, the International Psoriasis Council convened dermatology experts from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico in October 2015 to review the definition, approval, marketing and future of biosimilars in each country and develop a consensus statement. The regulatory framework for marketing approval of biosimilars in Latin America is currently a mosaic of disparate, country-specific, regulatory review processes, rules and standards, with considerable heterogeneity in clarity and specificity. Regulations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico have undergone multiple refinements whereas Colombia is finalizing draft guidelines. Verification of the similarity in quality, safety and efficacy of biosimilars to the innovator biologic remains a key challenge for policy makers and regulatory authorities. Other key regulatory challenges include: naming of agents and traceability, pharmacovigilance, extrapolation of indications, and interchangeability and substitution. An urgent need exists for more Latin American countries to establish national psoriasis registries and to integrate their common components into a multinational psoriasis network, thereby enhancing their interpretative power and impact. A Latin American psoriasis network similar to PSONET in Europe would assist health-care providers, pharmaceutical companies, regulators and patients to fully comprehend specific products being prescribed and dispensed and to identify potential regional trends or differences in safety or outcomes.

Abstract 170. Title: Monoclonal Antibody Biosimilars in Oncology: Critical Appraisal of Available Data on Switching.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29699853
Abstract: With the introduction of biosimilars of anticancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in oncology, physicians are potentially confronted with the question whether it is clinically adequate to switch patients who are clinically stable on treatment with the reference product to a newly available biosimilar (or vice versa/from 1 biosimilar to another). For a proper impact assessment of switching, robust, product-specific, and clinically relevant evidence should be required, ideally including data from appropriately designed switching studies. In this article, we assess the current body of switching data available for approved or proposed biosimilars of anticancer mAbs.
PubMed was systematically searched and ClinicalTrials.gov and abstract databases of selected congresses were hand-searched to identify all switching studies including biosimilars of anticancer mAbs.
We identified 8 switching studies with biosimilars of rituximab (CT-P10, GP2013, PF-05280586, and BCD-020) and trastuzumab (ABP 980). Two were performed in oncology indications and the other 6 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Key elements of a well-designed switching study, such as randomization and blinding, were contained in several of the studies, but significant limitations were also present. The most frequent limitations were low statistical power because of small patient numbers, lack of an appropriate control arm, short follow-up, chosen outcome measures, and (for studies performed in RA) the concern whether switching data can be extrapolated to oncology indications. Accordingly, the data from these studies need to be interpreted with caution. Of note, all identified studies included a single switch only, whereas multiple switches may occur in the real-world setting. The scientific need to evaluate the impact of repeated switching has been recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration, who incorporated such a requirement in its draft guidance on interchangeability.
From the scarce data available, the consequences of switching between reference product mAbs and their biosimilar(s) in the oncology setting are as yet unknown. Additional clinical evidence from well-designed switching studies is needed to guide switching decisions.

Abstract 171. Title: Biosimilars - terms of use.
Publication Date: 2015-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26397731
Abstract: The impending expiry of the patent on a number of leading biologic drugs has led to a surge in the development of 'biosimilar' or 'follow-on' products. However, in contrast to generic small-molecule medicines, biosimilars are not identical to their reference products. The differences and complexities surrounding both the molecular structure and the manufacturing process for biologics and biosimilars have resulted in a lack of clarity regarding the terms used in different parts of the world to define various aspects of development and utilization such as regulatory approval, pharmacovigilance, interchangeability and treatment-naivety. This makes quantitative evaluation of biosimilars a great challenge to both the scientific community and regulatory agencies. This manuscript attempts to clarify the terms used and address an important knowledge gap which is currently resulting in an increasing rush to position biosimilars for certain indications and patients in the absence of agreed upon definitions.

Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28940172
Abstract: GP2015 is the second biosimilar of the reference p75 TNF receptor-Fc fusion protein etanercept. It is approved for use in all indications for which reference etanercept is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis. GP2015 has similar physiochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference etanercept, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in healthy volunteers. GP2015 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; the tolerability, safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two agents were also generally similar. Switching between GP2015 and reference etanercept had no impact on clinical efficacy, tolerability or immunogenicity. The role of reference etanercept in the management of inflammatory autoimmune conditions is well established and GP2015 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring etanercept therapy.

Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28497220
Abstract: CT-P10 (Truxima™) is the first biosimilar of the reference monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. It is approved for use in all indications for which reference rituximab is approved, including follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. CT-P10 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference rituximab, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in patients with RA or FL. CT-P10 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference rituximab in patients with RA, and was generally well tolerated in this population as well as in patients with FL. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of CT-P10 were similar to those of reference rituximab, and switching from reference rituximab to CT-P10 had no impact on safety or efficacy. The role of reference rituximab in the management of autoimmune conditions and cancers is well established and CT-P10 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring rituximab therapy.

Abstract 174. Title: Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease: A review of post-marketing experience.
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-14
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28127193
Abstract: Biologic compounds are obtained from living organisms or cell cultures by means of biotechnology methods. A similar biologic drug, commonly called biosimilar, is a product copied by a native approved biologic drug whose license has expired. Biosimilar drugs usually are marketed at a lower price and provide important financial savings for public healthcare systems. Some differences between biosimilars and original biologic drugs might exist but they are acceptable if they fall within defined "boundaries of tolerance": differences in some features between the two molecules are considered important only if clinical relevant. Considering that the efficacy of the innovator biologic drug has already been established, the clinical studies required for approval of a biosimilar could be reduced compared with those required for the approval of the originator. In this review, real life data available in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with biosimilars are reported, documenting in general satisfactory outcomes, sustained efficacy and no sign of increased immunogenicity, although, further controlled data are awaited.

Abstract 175. Title: Efficacy and safety of rituximab biosimilar (CT-P10) in IgG4-related disease: an observational prospective open-label cohort study.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33386207
Abstract: Rituximab is increasingly used in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) but high costs limit its wide off-label administration. European and US regulatory agencies have recently approved rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of different rheumatologic and hematological conditions. No data are available, yet, on the efficacy and safety of rituximab biosimilars for the treatment of IgG4-RD. Scope of the present work is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 (RTX-B) in patients with IgG4-RD.
Patients with active IgG4-RD, naïve to rituximab or switched from the originator (RTX-O) to the biosimilar were treated with RTX-B and prospectively followed-up for 18 months. Safety and efficacy were assessed at six months. Relapse rate was assessed at 18 months. Disease activity was assessed by means of the IgG4-RD Responder Index (IgG4-RD RI).
Thirty-eight patients were included in this study. Thirty-three patients (87%) were naïve to RTX. Five patients (13%) relapsed after RTX-O and were switched to RTX-B. After six months, 21 patients (60%) achieved disease remission. The median serum IgG4 concentration decreased from 1344 to 575 mg/L (p < 0.01), and the median IgG4-RD RI decreased from 7.5 to 0 (p < 0.01). B-cell depletion was observed in all patients. Eight patients (36%) relapsed within 18 months. Side effects related to RTX-B administration were observed in 14 patients (37%). These results are in line with our previous experience with RTX-O.
The (Truxima<sup>TM</sup>) rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 represents a safe and effective alternative to rituximab originator for the treatment of IgG4-RD.

Abstract 176. Title: Methodologic considerations for noninterventional studies of switching from reference biologic to biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31298463
Abstract: As more biosimilars become available in the United States, postapproval noninterventional studies describing biosimilar switching and comparing effectiveness and/or safety between switchers and nonswitchers will play a key role in generating real-world evidence to inform clinical practices and policy decisions. Ensuring sound methodology is critical for making valid inferences from these studies.
The Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) convened a workgroup consisting of academic researchers, industry scientists, and practicing clinicians to establish best practice recommendations for the conduct of noninterventional studies of biosimilar and reference biologic switching. The workgroup members participated in eight teleconferences between August 2017 and February 2018 to discuss specific topics and build consensus.
This report provides workgroup recommendations covering five main considerations relating to noninterventional studies describing reference biologic to biosimilar switching and comparing reference biologic to biosimilars for safety and effectiveness in the presence of switching at treatment initiation and during follow-up: (a) selecting appropriate data sources from a range of available options including insurance claims, electronic health records, and registries; (b) study designs; (c) outcomes of interest including health care utilization and clinical endpoints; (d) analytic approaches including propensity scores, disease risk scores, and instrumental variables; and (e) special considerations including avoiding designs that ignore history of biologic use, avoiding immortal time bias, exposure misclassification, and accounting for postindex switching.
Recommendations provided in this report provide a framework that may be helpful in designing and critically evaluating postapproval noninterventional studies involving reference biologic to biosimilar switching.

Abstract 177. Title: Risk Assessment and Monitoring of Antibody Responses to Biosimilars in Chronic Inflammatory Diseases.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29189133
Abstract: The expiry of the patent of several leading biological medicinal products has led to a surge in the development of 'biosimilar' products. However, in contrast to generic small-molecule medicines, biosimilars are not identical to their reference medicinal products. Full comparability in quality as well as in preclinical and clinical issues is required to register a biosimilar. The potential to induce antidrug antibodies after treatment with biological medicinal products is a safety issue that is an important consideration in the development of biosimilars and a critical aspect of regulatory filings. Regulatory authorities in the European Union require antidrug antibody responses to be evaluated and to be approached from a safety perspective: the higher the potential of immunogenicity to adversely affect a patient's health, the more diligently one should clarify the immunogenicity of the product. So far, however, no specific recommendations were given on a method for risk assessment or on the extent of the requisite antidrug antibody characterization. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge on biosimilar products of infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept and present risk level-based schemes for the investigations of antidrug antibodies in non-clinical, clinical and pharmacovigilance studies.

ABP 980 has similar physicochemical and functional properties to those of reference trastuzumab, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in healthy subjects. In the phase 3 LILAC study, ABP 980 demonstrated similar clinical efficacy (based on central laboratory review sensitivity analysis) and tolerability to that of reference trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of ABP 980 were similar to those of reference trastuzumab, and a single switch from reference trastuzumab to ABP 980 had no impact on the immunogenicity or safety of ABP 980. The role of reference trastuzumab in the management of HER2-positive early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer is well established and ABP 980 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring trastuzumab therapy.

Abstract 179. Title: Uptake of rheumatology biosimilars in the absence of forced switching.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29633865
Abstract: To describe the uptake and system-level effects of the introduction of biosimilars in a setting without forced switching.
We used data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality register from start of marketing of infliximab (Remsima® and Inflectra®) and etanercept (Benepali®) biosimilars until 31 December 2016. We compared users of each originator-product and its biosimilar(s) by line of treatment: bDMARD-naïve patients, non-medical switchers (vs. matched patients remaining on originator), and patients switching from a previous bDMARD of another type.
From the start of marketing 1343 patients started an infliximab biosimilar (22 months) and 2691 started etanercept (9 months). Overall, the introduction of these biosimilars resulted in an increase of the total number of ongoing infliximab and etanercept treatments (originator + biosimilar) . At the end of the study period, biosimilars accounted for 31% of all infliximab treatments and 31% of all etanercept-treated patients. For each line of therapy, we noted only small differences in patient characteristics between those starting the originator product vs. its biosimilar(s).
Introduction of biosimilars have effects beyond replacement of the originator product, in terms of an increased rate of bDMARD initiation. Selection to non-medical switching displayed no particular disease- or patient-characteristics.

Abstract 180. Title: Biosimilar infliximab in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease: Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32743840
Abstract: Based on extrapolation, biosimilar infliximab (IFX) was approved to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The first studies in adults have shown similar efficacy and safety in comparison with reference drug. The aim of this review was to collect and evaluate all the literature data regarding the use of biosimilar IFX in paediatric IBD.
This article reviewed efficacy, immunogenicity and safety profile of biosimilar IFX in IBD paediatric patients through a comprehensive search of the published literature.
Eight papers were extracted and critically reviewed. Four paediatric studies (prospective, n = 3; retrospective, n = 1) assessed the induction efficacy of the biosimilar IFX. Clinical response and remission rates reported were 86%-90% and 67%-68%, respectively. No significant difference in clinical response and remission rates between the reference and biosimilar IFX groups was found at follow-up (range: 3-13 months). Similar findings were shown in the prospective studies (n = 4) conducted on patients elected to switch from reference IFX to its biosimilar. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) of biosimilar IFX were mild upper respiratory tract infections. Taking into account of all AEs coming from published data, biosimilar IFX seems to be as safe as its originator. Immunogenicity has not been significantly impacted by the switch from the reference drug.
To date, treatment with (or switch to) biosimilar IFX in paediatric patients with IBD have been successful, without affecting efficacy, immunogenicity or safety. However, further studies are warranted, including clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies.

Abstract 181. Title: Clinic- and Hospital-Based Home Care, Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT) and the Evolving Clinical Responsibilities of the Pharmacist.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-07
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33297356
Abstract: Clinic- and hospital-based home care describes models of care where services commonly associated with hospital inpatient care are provided at the patient's home or in an outpatient or community-based clinic. Hospital in the Home (HITH), also termed Hospital at Home (HaH) in parts of Europe and America, is a common and important example of this type of care. Other examples include infusion centers, skilled nursing facilities (particularly in the USA), self-administration models (including home infusion services) and administration through outpatient or community clinics. Different models of HITH care are used internationally and these encompass a wide range of services. Medication administration, particularly outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT), is an important element in many of these models of care. There is a key role for pharmacists since the provision of medication is integral in this model of patient care outside the hospital setting. Data on the growing importance of HITH and OPAT as well as the administration of medications suited to clinic- and hospital-based home care, including subcutaneous and intramuscular injectables, immunoglobulins and other blood fractions, cancer chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition, biologicals/biosimilars, vasopressors and enzymes, using differing service models, are described. The pharmacist's role is evolving from that involved primarily with dose preparation and supply of medications. Their clinical expertise in medication management ensures that they are an integral member and leader in these models of care. Their role ensures the safe and quality use of medicines, particularly across transitions of care, with the pharmacist taking on the roles of educator and consultant to patients and health professional colleagues. Activities such as antimicrobial stewardship and ongoing monitoring of patients and outcomes is fundamental to ensure quality patient outcomes in these settings.

Abstract 182. Title: The non-medical switching of prescription medications.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31081414
Abstract: Non-medical switching of medication, whereby a patient's treatment regimen is changed for reasons other than efficacy, side effects, or adherence, is often related to drug formulary changes aimed at reducing drug costs. In the era of health care reform, while cost-cutting measures are important, there is considerable evidence that non-medical switching, particularly when applied to medication used to treat chronic conditions such as diabetes, may impact patient outcomes, medication-taking behavior, and use of health care services. Ultimately, overall costs may be increased, as savings by insurers are cancelled out by higher costs to the health care system as a whole, such as extra administration, treatment failure from new medicines, and increased adverse events. The emergence of biosimilar and follow-on biologic treatments raises further questions among patients receiving biologic treatments, with patient advocacy groups calling for clear legislation to ensure that patients with complex or chronic conditions continue to receive effective, evidence-based medications for their disease. This article will discuss non-medical switching in the US, taking into account the different parties involved, such as patients, health care providers, pharmacists, payers, and pharmacy benefit managers, with the aim of providing a detailed overview of this complex and evolving topic.

Abstract 183. Title: A GUIDE TO FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS AND BIOSIMILARS WITH A FOCUS ON INSULIN.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466056
Abstract: Many healthcare providers in the U.S. are not familiar with follow-on biologics and biosimilars nor with their critical distinctions from standard generics. Our aim is to provide a detailed review of both, with a focus on insulins in the U.S. regulatory system.
Literature has been reviewed to provide information on various aspects of biosimilars and a follow-on biologic of insulin. This will include structure, efficacy, cost, switching, and legal issues.
Biologic products are large, complex molecules derived from living sources. Follow-on biologics are copies of the original innovator biologics. It is not possible to copy their structure exactly, leading to possible differences in efficacy and safety. Thus, regulations involving biologics are complex. Follow-on biologics are regulated under two Federal laws until March 23, 2020: the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Biosimilars are follow-on biologics which have been approved via the PHS Act. They consist of those which are "highly similar" to the reference drug and those which are "expected" to produce the same clinical result as the reference drug (interchangeable biosimilars). Interchangeable biosimilars have been determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be substitutable by the pharmacist "without the intervention" of the prescriber. From the patient perspective, switching to a follow-on biologic may necessitate a change in delivery device, which may create issues for patient adherence and dosing.
Although they present several challenges in terms of regulation and acceptance, follow-on biologics have the potential to significantly reduce costs for patients requiring insulin therapy.

Abstract 184. Title: [Biosimilar medicines. Scientific and legal disputes].
Publication Date: 2010-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20920856
Abstract: Patent expiry dates for early biotechnological drugs is giving rise to the availability of biosimilar drugs. According to the EMEA, these are defined as drugs with a biotechnological origin that have proven comparable to their reference product once the latter's patent expired. Modifications in the manufacturing process of biotechnological medications or treatment changes from one biotechnological molecule to another have not been debated until these biosimilar drugs have become available. It is then that, among other issues, the potential risks of their substitution for reference molecules became controversial. EMEA guidelines for biosimilar drug approval grant that these will be as effective and safe as any other newly available biotechnological medicinal product, or as any other drug undergoing changes in its manufacturing processes once marketed. Their availability will promote competition and reduce the high financial impact healthcare systems endure following the introduction of new therapies based on biotechnological drugs.

Abstract 185. Title: A rapid monitoring plan following a shift in coverage from brand name to biosimilar drugs for rheumatoid arthritis in British Columbia.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31914214
Abstract: To describe a rapid monitoring plan to assess the impacts of a shift in drug coverage for biosimilar drugs in British Columbia following the introduction of a new policy on 27 May 2019. The Biosimilars Initiative requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to switch to biosimilar versions of those drugs to maintain coverage. We propose a signal-detection method to provide near-real-time information to policymakers on the impacts of the policy change.
The exposure will be the Biosimilars Initiative, a policy affecting patients using originator infliximab (Remicade) and etanercept (Enbrel) for approved rheumatologic or dermatologic indications. Two policy cohorts and six historical control cohorts of patients using originator infliximab or etanercept will be assembled using linked and de-identified data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health. Patients will be identified during the 6-month period before the policy anniversary. Outcomes will include medication refills and switching, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and physician visits. Summary outcome measures, such as cumulative incidence or average quantity as applicable, will be examined daily and reported monthly for 1 year. Outcomes in the policy cohorts will be compared with historical controls using likelihood ratios.
The results of this rapid monitoring plan will be based on analyses involving approximately 9000 patients: four infliximab cohorts of approximately 430 patients and four etanercept cohorts of approximately 1800 patients.
Rapid monitoring results will inform ongoing policy decisions related to the Biosimilars Initiative, in terms of impacts on both patient health and health services utilization.

Abstract 186. Title: Biosimilar medicines - Review.
Publication Date: 2016-Mar-16
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27176756
Abstract: By definition, biosimilars are similar to a biological reference that has already received marketing authorization for biologic drugs.The purpose of biosimilars is reducing costs, thus increasing access to this treatment, however, the concerns of health professionals and users refer to the fact that to reduce costs will not neglecting the quality, effectiveness and especially security.
The aim of this study is then to assess the degree of similarity between the biosimilar and its reference biopharmaceuticals, trying to understand the production process, requirements necessary for approval, and its impact on the quality, safety, efficacy and costs.
For the systematic review without meta-analysis, we researched articles to the b-on, Pubmed and Medscape to 2005-2014, and selected 23 articles that contributed to the verification of the objectives of this study.
Several studies indicate that overall the biosimilar and biological reference showed no significant differences except those inherent to the production process, being the first susceptible to comparability tests demonstrating the similarity in terms of clinical efficacy and safety.
Biosimilars will be increasingly present in the future as promising therapeutic arsenal and targeted therapy, however, issues related to immunogenicity, interchangeability, automatic substitution and extrapolation of indications should continue to be studied and debated.

Abstract 187. Title: Interchangeability among reference insulin analogues and their biosimilars: regulatory framework, study design and clinical implications.
Publication Date: 2016-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27097592
Abstract: Biosimilars are regulated differently from small-molecule generic, chemically derived medicines. The complexity of biological products means that small changes in manufacturing or formulation may result in changes in efficacy and safety of the final product. In the face of this complexity, the regulatory landscape for biosimilars continues to evolve, and global harmonization regarding requirements is currently lacking. It is essential that clinicians and patients are reassured that biosimilars are equally safe and effective as their reference product, and this is particularly important when interchangeability, defined as 'changing one medicine for another one which is expected to achieve the same clinical effect in a given clinical setting in any one patient', is considered. Although the automatic substitution (i.e. substitution without input from the prescribing healthcare provider) of biosimilars for reference products is currently not permitted by the majority of countries, this may change in the future. In order to demonstrate interchangeability between reference products and a biosimilar, more stringent and specific studies of the safety and efficacy of biosimilars are likely to be needed; however, guidance on the design of and the need for any such studies is currently limited. The present article provides an overview of the current regulatory framework around the demonstration of interchangeability with biosimilars, with a specific focus on biosimilar insulin analogues, and details experiences with other biosimilar products. In addition, designs for studies to evaluate interchangeability with a biosimilar insulin analogue product are proposed and a discussion about the implications of interchangeability in clinical practice is included.

Abstract 188. Title: Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment. A Back to the Drawing Board Project or High Expectations for Low Unmet Needs?
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-16
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426398
Abstract: Despite the significant progress in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) therapeutics, there are several reports in the literature claiming that the size of unmet needs in RA is large. In the era before biologics, there was indeed a significant number of patients who did not achieve low disease activity (LDA) or disease remission due to limited therapeutic choices in the doctors' armamentarium. Treatment wise, great progress has been achieved over the last decades with the discovery and introduction in therapeutics of new molecules, such as the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. Today, with such a plethora of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs, tsDMARDs, and bDMARDs, why are we unable to successfully treat RA patients? What is wrong? However, a new drug for RA does not mean it is necessary to switch to a new treatment. It is very easy to change and switch therapies when the patient complains about pain and stiffness. In this setting, it is obligatory to rule out other comorbidities and disorders that may be the cause of the pain first. Thus, clinicians must have a deep knowledge of the drug therapy and be able to adjust the treatment when needed. A minute clinical examination must be carried out on every visit with close monitoring of the patient. A treat-to-target (T2T) approach and the application of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) recommendations and strategies should minimize the unmet needs.

Abstract 189. Title: Solution-driven approaches to generic substitution challenges - a survey among international experts.
Publication Date: 2015-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26214281
Abstract: The main objective of this study was to explore the perception and understanding of economic, legal, and social barriers that may restrain generic uptake among recognized international experts in health care, and to identify and verify recommendations on how to streamline generic substitution (GS) at no expense of therapeutic safety. A questionnaire survey was devised, and experts with world-renowned expertise in the field of generic medicinal products were selected. Almost 3/4 of respondents claimed that all drugs that satisfy bioequivalence criteria represent similar efficacy and adverse effects, and 1/4 of respondents believed that some differences could be reported. The majority of experts supported (i) the right of patients to refuse GS, (ii) the right of physicians to veto GS, and (iii) the introduction of a statutory obligation to provide patients with access to the cheapest generics available on the market. The main obstacles to more general uptake of generics were as follows: (i) perception of generics as lower quality products, (ii) absence of a transparent policy governing GS, and (iii) disincentives to pharmacists and physicians. Among the most popular recommendations were as follows: (i) introduction of various measures to aid physicians in generic prescribing, (ii) setting clear guidelines specifying when GS is not advisable, (iii) supporting competition on the generic market. The views of experts and the resulting recommendations were strongly affected by their opinion on the bioequivalence of generics. From this analysis, we have selected several principal recommendations which could help shape successful healthcare policies regarding GS.

Abstract 190. Title: Uptake of biosimilars for TNF-α inhibitors adalimumab and etanercept following the best-value biological medicine initiative in Ireland.
Publication Date: 2021-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33560486
Abstract: Background There is over 10 years of clinical experience and evidence to show that biosimilar medicines can be used as safely and effectively in approved therapeutic indications as their originator biological medicines. In Ireland, biosimilar medicine uptake has been very slow, and savings to the health service will only be realised through fostering a competitive biological medicine market. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the utilisation of biosimilars following a 'best-value biological' medicine initiative for adalimumab and etanercept in the Irish healthcare setting. Methods Data was extracted from the National High Tech claims database and High Tech ordering and management hub for the following drugs; adalimumab (Humira®, Amgevita®, Hulio®, Idacio®, and Imraldi®) and etanercept (Enbrel® and Benepali®). Main outcome measure: uptake of the best-value biological medicines. Results In June 2019, just over 90 patients had been initiated on, or switched to a best-value biological for adalimumab or etanercept. Over the next 12 months this increased to over 8500 patients. With the best-value biologicals accounting for approximately 50 % of market share in June 2020, the combined estimated savings and avoided costs are €22.7 million to date. The gain-share prescribing incentive has raised over €3.6 million for the specialties to invest back into patient care. Conclusion Against the background of a finite healthcare budget, this study shows that increasing use of biosimilars can create the financial savings and space to invest in new innovative therapies for the benefit of many patients.

Abstract 191. Title: Barriers to the uptake of biosimilars and possible solutions: a Belgian case study.
Publication Date: 2014-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24803078
Abstract: Biosimilars are medicinal products that are similar to a biopharmaceutical that has already been authorised. As biopharmaceuticals are expected to dominate the best-selling pharmaceuticals worldwide by 2016, the emergence of biosimilars imposes an important challenge for governments. At this moment, the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium is limited, with market shares close to 0%.
This study aimed to identify the barriers that impede the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate in depth the barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium. Respondents were selected through selective sampling so that all different stakeholders were represented (authorities, physicians, pharmacists, patients, academics and industry). Respondents were contacted by e-mail and letter with a request for participation. A thematic framework was used to analyze the data.
Three main barriers to the uptake of biosimilars in the Belgian market were identified: a lack of confidence towards biosimilars by some stakeholders; uncertainty about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars; and a hospital financing system that discourages the use of them. Providing all stakeholders with objective information on the concept of biosimilars, reforming the financing of hospitals, developing and implementing prescription quota in hospitals, setting up patient registries for biosimilars and speeding up the pricing and reimbursement process of biosimilars are suggested solutions to increase the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium.
To fully capture the potential savings of biosimilars, governments should take measures to increase their uptake. The Belgian government, and also the manufacturers of biosimilars, should take measures to reduce the uncertainties related to biosimilars and raise confidence among prescribers. In addition, the financing of hospitals should be reformed and incentives should be developed to stimulate physicians to prescribe biosimilars.

Abstract 192. Title: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis about the safety and efficacy of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31492986
Abstract: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
We searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials discussing CT-P31 administration for IBD patients either naïve to biological therapy or switched from IFX therapy. Data of the rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and adverse events were extracted and pooled in a random effect model meta-analysis using CMA version 2.
Thirty-two studies with a total of 3464 IBD patients treated with CT-P13 were identified. The pooled rates of clinical response among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) at 8-14 weeks were 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72 to 0.87) and 0.68 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.72), respectively, and at 48-63 weeks were 0.69 (95% CI = 0.48 to 0.85) and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.45 to 0.63) respectively. After switching from IFX to CT-P13, the pooled rates of sustained clinical response among CD and UC at 30-32 weeks were 0.84 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.58 to 0.99), respectively, and at 48-63 weeks were 0.51 (95% CI = 0.22 to 0.79) and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.19 to 0.99) respectively. Moreover, adverse events were reported (CD = 0.10, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.22; UC = 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.15).
CT-P13 is effective and well tolerated in short and long-term periods. Switching to CT-P13 is recommended for the management of IBD.

Abstract 193. Title: The safety of switching between therapeutic proteins.
Publication Date: 2012-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22849511
Abstract: The approval of several biosimilars in the past years has prompted discussion on potential safety risks associated with switching to and from these products. It has been suggested that switching may lead to safety concerns. However, data is limited on the clinical effects of switching.
In this review we provide an overview of data related to switching between human recombinant growth hormones, erythropoietins and granulocyte colony stimulating agents. We reviewed data from clinical trials, pharmacovigilance databases and an overview of the literature on the frequency of switching between these products. The review covers both switching between innovator products within the same product class and switching to and from biosimilars.
Data on the frequency of switching in clinical practice is scarce, but it seems most frequent for erythropoietins. We have found no evidence from clinical trial data or post marketing surveillance data that switching to and from different biopharmaceuticals leads to safety concerns.

Abstract 194. Title: Real-World Evidence on Etanercept Biosimilar SB4 in Etanercept-Naïve or Switching Patients: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2019-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31385263
Abstract: In 2016, SB4 (Benepali<sup>®</sup>) became the first etanercept (ETN) biosimilar to obtain marketing authorisation in Europe. Despite robust analytical and clinical comparisons, outstanding questions remain on SB4 use in routine practice.
A systematic search for publications on real-world evidence of SB4 effectiveness, safety and drug survival was undertaken using search terms (SB4 OR Benepali OR biosimilar etanercept OR innovator etanercept) in the BIOSIS<sup>®</sup> Toxicology, BIOSIS Previews<sup>®</sup>, Embase<sup>®</sup> and MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> databases up to 17 January 2019.
Of 959 articles identified, eight journal articles, two journal letters and 23 congress abstracts were selected on criteria of original real-world evidence with a clinical focus. As expected with real-world evidence, quality scoring showed that the evidence had high external validity but lower internal validity. A total of 13,552 patients were described across nine European countries and all approved SB4 indications: 2499 were ETN-naïve and 11,053 switched from reference ETN to SB4 (switchers). Switch acceptance rates (a combination of clinicians offering and patients accepting initiation on SB4) ranged between 51.6% and 99.0%; patient support programmes positively contributed to acceptance. Disease activity was generally similar pre- and post-switch (typically 3-month timeframe). Retention rates across studies were at least 75% (up to 12 months follow-up). No new safety signals were identified. Differences in discontinuation rates versus historic controls reported in some studies may have been influenced by differences in treatment practices, lack of clinician confidence and nocebo effects.
Nearly 2500 ETN-naïve patients have been initiated on SB4 and outcomes are similar to those patients receiving reference ETN. Overall this systematic review of real-world evidence provides additional reassurance that SB4 is as effective and safe as reference ETN in both switched and naïve patients.

Abstract 195. Title: Are we ready to close the discussion on the interchangeability of biosimilars?
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31254488
Abstract: Since the introduction of the first biosimilar the discussion about their interchangeability has persisted. The body of evidence gathered for biosimilars provides reassurance that they are approved based on a rigorous comparability exercise and do not show clinically meaningful differences to their reference products. There are no data suggesting that the risk of switching to a biosimilar in terms of increased immunogenicity is greater than switching between two batches of any biologic. The key concern around switching biosimilars is the nocebo effect, which reinforces the need for physician involvement when switching. Whereas this might argue against automatic substitution of biosimilars, it is not a biosimilars-specific concern. To increase physician confidence in biosimilars, regulators should acknowledge that biosimilars are interchangeable.

Abstract 196. Title: Switching maintenance infliximab therapy to biosimilar infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28838273
Abstract: Clinical use of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is based on extrapolation of indication from clinical studies performed in rheumatological diseases. Only few data exist of behaviour of infliximab trough levels (TLs) and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) during switching.
The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in TLs, ADA formation and disease activity after switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar one.
All our IBD patients receiving maintenance infliximab therapy were switched to biosimilar infliximab. TLs and ADAs were measured before the last originator infusion and before the third biosimilar infusion. Laboratory values, disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Harvey-Bradshaw index) and demographic data were collected from patient records.
A total of 62 patients were included in the final analysis (32 Crohn's disease, 30 ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD-unclassified). No significant changes in median TLs before (5.5 mg/l) and after switching (5.5 mg/l, p = .05) occurred in the entire study group or in the Crohn's disease (CD) subgroup (5.75 and 6.5 mg/l, p = .68). However, in the subgroup of ulcerative colitis, the change in median TL was significantly different (from 5.2 to 4.25 mg/l, p = .019). Two patients developed ADAs after switching. No changes in disease activity were detected during switching and no safety concerns occurred.
Switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab resulted in statistically significant differences in infliximab TLs in patients with UC but not in patients with Crohn's disease. The clinical significance for this difference is doubtful and in neither group changes in disease activity occurred.

Abstract 197. Title: Switching to biosimilars: current perspectives in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31056970
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: The expiry of patents for biologics has led to the introduction of biosimilars for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). These treatment alternatives may allow earlier and wider access to appropriate therapy for patients without increasing the economic burden on health-care systems. Prescription of biosimilars to treatment-naïve patients is well accepted; however, additional considerations must be taken into account when switching clinically stable patients from reference products to biosimilars. <b>Area covered</b>: We discuss the current considerations related to switching from reference products to biosimilars from a physician and patient perspective. We review the clinical data and real-life experience on switching patients with IMIDs, present the position of the relevant medical societies, and discuss the importance of patient-physician communication and need for shared decision-making. <b>Expert opinion</b>: The introduction of biosimilars provides an opportunity to expand access to treatment for patients with IMIDs across Europe and support the financial sustainability of health-care systems. We anticipate that as the real-world evidence base grows, confirming the results of clinical trials, there will be a corresponding increase in physician and patient acceptance, not only to initiating treatment with a biosimilar, but also to switching medication from a reference product to a biosimilar.

To examine safety, efficacy and time to discontinuation (drug survival) of biologics (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab) and compare originators with biosimilars (i.e. Enbrel with Benepali, and Remicade with Remsima).
The DERMBIO registry contains data on all Danish patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with biologics. We examined patients treated between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression to examine drug survival patterns.
A total of 3495 treatment series (2161 patients) were included (adalimumab n = 1332; etanercept n = 579; infliximab n = 333; ustekinumab n = 1055 and secukinumab n = 196). Secukinumab had the highest number of PASI 100 (100% improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) respondents, but also the lowest drug survival among all the biologics. Ustekinumab had the highest drug survival overall. There were no significant differences in discontinuation risk between originator and biosimilar versions of infliximab or etanercept. Treatment with higher than approved dosages was frequent for all drugs except for adalimumab and secukinumab. Adverse events (predominantly infections) were most frequent for secukinumab compared with the other agents.
Ustekinumab was associated with the highest drug survival, and secukinumab with the lowest, although most patients on secukinumab were non-naïve. Switching from originator to biosimilar had no significant impact on drug survival, and the safety profiles were comparable. Adverse events occurred most frequently with secukinumab. Future studies are warranted to assess the long-term safety of novel biologics for psoriasis.

Abstract 199. Title: Patient and Healthcare Professionals Preference for Brenzys vs. Enbrel Autoinjector for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Randomized Crossover Simulated-Use Study.
Publication Date: 2017-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417318
Abstract: Brenzys was developed as an etanercept biosimilar of Enbrel. The aim of this study was to assess preference and perceived ease of use for the new Brenzys autoinjector compared to the currently available marketed Enbrel MYCLIC autoinjector (Australia) and Enbrel SureClick autoinjector (Canada) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because RA affects manual dexterity, ease of use of an autoinjector is a particularly important consideration in developing effective self-delivery of long-term courses of therapy.
Patients (N = 191) reporting a diagnosis of RA and nurses and rheumatologists (N = 90) with experience managing RA were shown how to use Brenzys and Enbrel autoinjectors (in counterbalanced order between participants), then they used each autoinjector by injecting into a pad simulating skin, and completed a questionnaire. Study sessions took place in Australia and Canada.
A binomial test showed that significantly more patients indicated that the Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use than the Enbrel autoinjector (79% reporting Brenzys easier to use; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [73%, 85%]). In addition, significantly more nurses and rheumatologists with experience managing RA also indicated that the Brenzys autoinjector was easier to use (86%; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [77%, 92%) and that they would recommend the buttonless Brenzys autoinjector over the Enbrel autoinjector to patients (83%; p < 0.001, two-sided, 95% CI [74%, 90%]). Almost all patients who reported past experience using an Enbrel autoinjector (N = 17) reported on the basis of using the two devices in the study that they would prefer to switch their device to the Brenzys autoinjector rather than continue their course of therapy using the Enbrel autoinjector (16/17, 94%, 95% CI [71%, 100%]).
On the basis of the study results, the Brenzys autoinjector was rated statistically significantly easier to use, and was overall preferred by patients and healthcare professionals with experience managing RA patients.

Abstract 200. Title: Quantification of active infliximab in human serum with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a tumor necrosis factor alpha -based pre-analytical sample purification and a stable isotopic labeled infliximab bio-similar as internal standard: A target-based, sensitive and cost-effective method.
Publication Date: 2016-Jul-08
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27264745
Abstract: The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Infliximab (IFX) is a widely used drug for the treatment of several inflammatory autoimmune diseases. However, approximately 10% of patients develop anti-infliximab antibodies (ATIs) rendering the treatment ineffective. Early detection of underexposure to unbound IFX would result in a timely switch of therapy which could aid in the treatment of this disease. Streptavidin coated 96 well plates were used to capture biotinylated-tumor necrosis factor -alpha (b-TNF-α), which in turn was used to selectively extract the active form of IFX in human serum. After elution, IFX was digested using trypsin and one signature peptide was selected for subsequent analysis on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The internal standard used was a stable isotopic labeled IFX bio-similar. The assay was successfully validated according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and was found to be linear in a range of 0.5-20μg/mL (r(2)=0.994). Lower limit of quantification for the assay (<20% CV) was 0.5μg/mL, requiring only 2μL of sample. Cross-validation against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) resulted in a high correlation between methods (r(2)=0.95 with a ρc=0.83) and the accuracy was in line with previously published results. In conclusion, a sensitive, robust and cost-effective method was developed for the bio-analysis of IFX with LC-MS/MS by means of a target-based pre-analytical sample purification. Moreover, low volume and costs of consumables per sample promote its feasibility in (pre)clinical studies and in therapeutic drug monitoring. This method should be considered as first choice due to its accuracy and multiple degree of selectivity.

Abstract 201. Title: Biosimilars in rheumatology: recommendations for regulation and use in Middle Eastern countries.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411181
Abstract: The increasing availability of biosimilar medicines in Middle Eastern regions may provide an opportunity to increase the number of rheumatology patients who have access to traditionally more expensive biologic medicines. However, as well as a lack of real-world data on the use of biosimilar medicines in practice, the availability of intended copies in the region may undermine physician confidence in prescribing legitimate biosimilar medicines. There is a need for regional recommendations for healthcare professionals to ensure that biosimilar drugs can be used safely. Therefore, a literature search was performed with the aim of providing important recommendations for the regulation and use of biosimilar medicines in the Middle East from key opinion leaders in rheumatology from the region. These recommendations focus on improving the availability of relevant real-world data, ensuring that physicians are aware of the difference between intended copies and true biosimilars and ensuring that physicians are responsible for making any prescribing and switching decisions.

Abstract 202. Title: Adalimumab for nail psoriasis: efficacy and safety over 52 weeks from a phase-3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31304993
Abstract: Few clinical trials have evaluated long-term treatment of nail psoriasis with biologics.
Safety and efficacy of adalimumab [ADA; Humira AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA)] long-term treatment (52 weeks) was evaluated in a phase-3, randomized trial in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and concomitant moderate-to-severe fingernail psoriasis. Results from the first 26 weeks (Period A) have been reported.
Patients receiving 40 mg ADA every other week or placebo in Period A, continued with or switched to 40 mg ADA every-other-week treatment in the subsequent 26-week open-label extension (OLE) period. Main efficacy evaluations were ≥75% improvement in total-fingernail modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI 75) and achievement of Physician's Global Assessment for Fingernail Psoriasis of clear or minimal disease (PGA-F 0/1) with a ≥2-grade improvement from baseline, across the trial for patients who continued ADA from Period A through the OLE (Continuous-ADA Population). Safety was evaluated during the OLE and for patients receiving ADA at any time during the study (All-ADA Population).
Of the 217 patients initially randomized in Period A, 188 (86.6%; 94 in each treatment group) entered the OLE after completion of or early escape from Period A. For the Continuous-ADA Population (N = 109), endpoint achievement rates improved from OLE entry (Week 26) to Week 52, including total-fingernail mNAPSI 75 (47.4-54.5%); PGA-F 0/1 (51.1-55.6%) and total-fingernail mNAPSI = 0 (6.6-17.9%). Serious adverse event and serious infection rates for the All-ADA Population (N = 203) were 6.9% and 3.4%, respectively.
In this population of psoriasis patients with concomitant, moderate-to-severe nail psoriasis, long-term efficacy and improvement in signs and symptoms of nail disease were demonstrated after every-other-week ADA treatment, including incremental improvements in rate of total clearance of nail disease. No new safety risks were identified for patients receiving at least one ADA dose across 52 weeks.

Abstract 203. Title: Long-term efficacy and safety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis continuing on SB4 or switching from reference etanercept to SB4.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-09
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28794078
Abstract: SB4 (Benepali, Brenzys) is a biosimilar of reference etanercept (ETN). In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study, SB4 demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to ETN in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The open-label extension period evaluated long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity when continuing SB4 versus switching from ETN to SB4.
In the randomised, double-blind phase, patients received weekly subcutaneous administration of 50 mg SB4 or ETN with background methotrexate for up to 52 weeks. Patients in the Czech Republic and Poland who completed the 52-week visit were enrolled in the open-label extension period and received SB4 for 48 additional weeks. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 100.
Of 245 patients entering the extension period, 126 continued to receive SB4 (SB4/SB4) and 119 switched to SB4 (ETN/SB4). American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates were sustained and comparable between SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 with ACR20 response rates at week 100 of 77.9% and 79.1%, respectively. Other efficacy results, including radiographic progression, were also comparable between the groups. After week 52, rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 47.6% (SB4/SB4) and 48.7% (ETN/SB4); one patient/group developed non-neutralising antidrug antibodies. No cases of active tuberculosis or injection-site reactions were reported during the extension period. One patient (SB4/SB4) died of hepatic cancer.
SB4 was effective and well tolerated over 2 years in patients with RA. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were comparable between the SB4/SB4 and ETN/SB4 groups, showing no risk associated with switching patients from ETN to SB4.

Abstract 205. Title: On the interchangeability of biologic drug products.
Publication Date: 2013-Feb-10
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22911936
Abstract: Interchangeability of drug products has very different features with small molecules and with biologicals. With small-molecule drugs, a statement of bioequivalence generally indicates therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability. In contrast, with the much more sensitive and complicated biological drugs, a declaration of biosimilarity emphatically does not imply that a patient could be switched from one product to another. Both formulations may be prescribed and administered to subjects who have not received yet the drug in any of its forms. However, regulatory agencies have been very cautious about enabling and permitting interchangeability. Notably, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of the USA sets very formidable and severe conditions for enabling the interchangeability of biological drug products. The background and conditions for the interchangeability of both small-molecule and biologic drug products are presented in detail.

Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31023141
Abstract: The Biological Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) of 2009 established a pathway for the approval of biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars in the United States. The Food Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several guidances on the development and assessment of biosimilars which implement the BPCI Act. In particular, a recent draft guidance on the interchangeability of biological products presents an overview of scientific considerations on the demonstration of interchangeability with a reference product. The present communication provides a general summary of the draft guidance and briefly observes a few current issues on interchangeability.

Abstract 207. Title: Biosimilars: An Approach to some Current Worldwide Regulation Frameworks.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30360724
Abstract: Developing new biologics has led to regulations and norms aimed at guaranteeing their safety, quality and effectiveness, in terms of marketing, prescription, use, interchangeability and switching. Biologics are of great importance in treating patients suffering from rheumatic, autoimmune, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. The expiry/lapse of reference biologics or originators' patents has meant that developing biosimilars involves accompanying legal requirements for their approval in countries worldwide. This paper has thus approached the situation of biosimilar regulation worldwide, the pertinent technical concepts and regulatory differences in some countries of interest.

Abstract 208. Title: The Role of Biosimilars in Uveitis: Long-Term Real-World Outcomes of the Switch From Original to Biosimilar TNF-Alpha Inhibitors.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31920658
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Recent expiry of patents for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors has led to the employment of biosimilars in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to identify any change in the control of ocular inflammatory manifestations among patients with non-infectious uveitis switching from an originator to a corresponding anti-TNF-α biosimilar. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-seven consecutive patients (62 eyes involved) with non-infectious uveitis undergoing the switch from anti-TNF-α originators to biosimilars were retrospectively enrolled; the frequency of ocular flares before and after the switch as well as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), daily systemic corticosteroid intake, and frequency of uveitic macular edema (UME) at the switch and at the following assessments were statistically analysed. <b>Results:</b> The number of ocular flares during the 12 months preceding the switch was 16, corresponding to 3.6 flares/100 patients/12 months; the number of flares after the switch was 14, corresponding to 2.0 flares/100 patients/12 months. No statistically significant differences were identified in the frequency of flares (<i>p</i> = 0.84) and in the number of patients experiencing ocular flares (<i>p</i> = 0.39) between the twelve months preceding the switch and the period thereafter. No statistically significant changes were observed in the BCVA (<i>p</i> = 0.27), CMT (<i>p</i> = 0.50), frequency of UME (<i>p</i> = 0.57) and daily corticosteroid intake (<i>p</i> = 0.42) between the time of the switch and the last follow-up visit. <b>Conclusions:</b> The switch to biosimilars represents a feasible treatment choice associated with the maintenance of clinical efficacy in patients with non-infectious uveitis previously treated with the corresponding originator anti-TNF-α biologic agents.

Abstract 209. Title: The design of clinical trials to support the switching and alternation of biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2016-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27666115
Abstract: Loss of exclusivity for biological therapeutics opens the door for biosimilar development. Biosimilars must demonstrate structural, functional, and clinical similarity with a currently approved biological originator product. A therapeutic alternative for biologic-naive patients, a single switch from an originator to biosimilar has also been studied in clinically stable patients; further, switching therapy multiple times (alternating) between an originator and a biosimilar has been investigated. Because biosimilars are not identical to originators and no robust clinical data have convincingly demonstrated that switching or alternating therapy of stable patients is safe and efficacious, there is an imperative need to understand the characteristics of well-designed clinical trials to support these practices. Areas covered: Clinical trials of biosimilars are reviewed, with an emphasis on trial designs that incorporate therapy switching, including the NOR-SWITCH study as an example. Expert opinion: As currently designed, biosimilar clinical trials provide insufficient information to support switching or alternating between originator products and their biosimilars. Lack of regulatory guidance contributes to this void. More robust data are required to inform the safety and efficacy of switching or alternating therapies, particularly regarding immunogenicity risks. Studies that also include alternations of therapy are needed to address these knowledge gaps.

Abstract 210. Title: Systematic review: efficacy and safety of switching patients between reference and biosimilar infliximab.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30411382
Abstract: Biosimilar versions of widely prescribed drugs, including the tumour-necrosis factor antagonist infliximab, are becoming increasingly available. As biosimilars are not identical copies of reference products, evidence may be required to demonstrate that switching between a reference biologic and biosimilars is safe and efficacious. To establish interchangeability, US Food and Drug Administration guidance states that studies must demonstrate that biosimilars remain equivalent or non-inferior to a reference product after multiple switches between products.
To investigate the evidence evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching between reference and biosimilar infliximab in patients with inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis.
Published studies presenting data on switching between reference and biosimilar infliximab were identified by searching the MEDLINE database. Congress abstracts were identified by searching the EMBASE database and manually searching abstracts from relevant congresses.
A total of 113 journal articles and 149 abstracts were found. Of these, 70 were considered relevant and included in this analysis. Most of the publications were uncontrolled, observational studies. Data from six randomised, controlled trials were identified. In general, the evidence revealed no clinically important efficacy or safety signals associated with switching.
While available data have not identified significant risks associated with a single switch between reference and biosimilar infliximab, the studies available currently report on only single switches and were mostly observational studies lacking control arms. Additional data are needed to explore potential switching risks in various populations and scenarios.

Abstract 211. Title: The Challenges of Switching Therapies in an Evolving Multiple Biosimilars Landscape: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32910420
Abstract: With the increasing availability of biosimilars, the practice of switching therapies for non-medical reasons between an originator biologic and an analogous biosimilar has become more common. The evidence to support this practice mostly comes from single-switch randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world (RW) evidence studies. However, as more biosimilars of the same originator enter the market, multiple switching events between originators and biosimilars is becoming a reality, despite limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of such practice. Some countries have established guidelines, policies, or laws related to interchangeability and/or automatic substitution, whereas others have left these practices unregulated or controlled by other components of the healthcare system. Collectively, guidelines on single non-medical switching are often vague, with even less focus given to multiple non-medical switching, leaving this practice mostly unregulated. This narrative review will first discuss the current regulatory perspectives on non-medical switching and challenges associated with switching therapies, particularly with the availability of multiple biosimilars. We will then review the current evidence from RCTs and RW studies in the light of three different multiple-switch scenarios currently taking place in clinical practice: switching between an originator and a single biosimilar, switching between biosimilars of the same originator, and the clinical practice of switching back to the originator (i.e., switchbacks) after a failure of the initial non-medical switch to the analogous biosimilar.

Abstract 212. Title: Inflammatory diseases: Integrating biosimilars into clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26058549
Abstract: To discuss considerations regarding the selection, prescribing, and monitoring of biosimilars in the clinical management of patients with inflammatory disorders.
A search of the Internet as well as PubMed was conducted through August 2014 for information related to the clinical use of biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders using the keywords biosimilar, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn׳s disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for biosimilar guidelines.
Articles and guidelines relating to integrating biosimilars into the clinical management of patients with inflammatory disorders have been published by regulatory agencies, professional associations, healthcare providers, and others.
The recent approval of the biosimilar infliximab in some countries makes biosimilars a reality for rheumatologists and others involved in the care of patients with inflammatory disorders. To successfully and confidently integrate biosimilars into clinical practice, physicians must understand factors such as variation in innovator/reference products, extrapolation of data, naming and labeling, interchangeability and automatic substitution, and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract 213. Title: The use of biosimilar medicines in oncology - position statement of the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology (SBOC).
Publication Date: 2018-Jan-11
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29340530
Abstract: A biosimilar is a biologic product that is similar to a reference biopharmaceutical product, the manufacturing process of which hinders the ability to identically replicate the structure of the original product, and therefore, it cannot be described as an absolute equivalent of the original medication. The currently available technology does not allow for an accurate copy of complex molecules, but it does allow the replication of similar molecules with the same activity. As biosimilars are about to be introduced in oncology practice, these must be evaluated through evidence-based medicine. This manuscript is a position paper, where the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology (SBOC) aims to describe pertinent issues regarding the approval and use of biosimilars in oncology. As a working group on behalf of SBOC, we discuss aspects related to definition, labeling/nomenclature, extrapolation, interchangeability, switching, automatic substitution, clinical standards on safety and efficacy, and the potential impact on financial burden in healthcare. We take a stand in favor of the introduction of biosimilars, as they offer a viable, safe, and cost-effective alternative to the biopharmaceutical products currently used in cancer. We hope this document can provide valuable information to support therapeutic decisions that maximize the clinical benefit for the thousands of cancer patients in Brazil and can contribute to expedite the introduction of this new drug class in clinical practice. We expect the conveyed information to serve as a basis for further discussion in Latin America, this being the first position paper issued by a Latin American Oncology Society.

Abstract 214. Title: [Interchangeability of biological products in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS): the main regulatory challenges].
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31618379
Abstract: Biological products have sparked a worldwide therapeutic revolution. However, the high cost of these products threatens health systems' sustainability. The development of copies is considered an economic alternative, but due to the products' complexity, many concepts used in generic drugs do not apply. Interchangeability between biologicals poses a regulatory challenge. This essay discusses the main regulatory challenges for establishing criteria for interchangeability between new biologicals and their copies in the scope of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), considering the guidelines adopted by the world's main drug regulatory agencies concerning interchangeability and the prevailing Brazilian regulatory framework on this issue. Concerns related to the interchangeability of biologicals include automatic substitution, nomenclature, pharmacovigilance, immunogenicity, and extrapolation of therapeutic indications and clinical data from new biologicals to their copies. While the clinical success and economic benefits of switching from new biologicals to their biosimilars have already been observed, the heterogeneity between countries in the regulatory barriers to the approval of copies of biologicals should be taken into consideration during the regulation of interchangeability of biologicals in Brazil.

Abstract 215. Title: Use of biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease: a position update of the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD).
Publication Date: 2019-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30872085
Abstract: The first infliximab biosimilar for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was introduced in 2013, and today eight anti-TNF alpha biosimilars (three for infliximab and five for adalimumab) have been approved and licensed by the European Medicines Agency. Biosimilars present great potential in terms of cost saving and possible consequential reinvestment in the health care system. The increasing knowledge about the process of biosimilar development and use in IBD and the publication of many prospective clinical studies and real-life clinical experiences have progressively changed the point of view of IBD physicians. In the present position paper, the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease present and discuss their updated statements and positions on this topic, with emphasis on the concepts of biosimilarity and extrapolation across indications, safety and immunogenicity, interchangeability and switching, automatic substitution, and, finally, patient education about biosimilars.

Abstract 216. Title: Biosimilars of adalimumab: the upcoming challenge in IBD.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30601098
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Biosimilars represent great potential in cost saving and re-investment opportunities in healthcare and allow patients greater access to effective mAbs. Infliximab biosimilars are successfully used in all indications for whom the reference product (RP) was approved. <b>Areas covered</b>: In late 2018, adalimumab biosimilars will also be available in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). ABP501, BI 695501, GP2017, and SB5 have been approved by the EMA for the same indications of the reference product (RP, Humira®). Preclinical data show high similarity between all biosimilars and the RP. Clinical data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis also show no differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Data in IBD patients are still lacking. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Biosimilars of adalimumab appear to be clinically equivalent to the RP. Decisions based on choosing the ideal patient to receive or to be switched to a biosimilar of adalimumab, or choosing one biosimilar vs. another, or cross-switching among biosimilars remain the next challenge in the field of IBD.

Abstract 217. Title: The PROSIT-BIO Cohort: A Prospective Observational Study of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treated with Infliximab Biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092307
Abstract: Few data are available on the safety and efficacy of infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
A prospective, multicenter, cohort study using a structured database.
Consecutive patients (313 Crohn's disease and 234 ulcerative colitis) were enrolled from 31 referral centers; 311 patients were naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, 139 had a previous exposure to biologics, and the remaining 97 were switched to CT-P13 after a mean of 18 ± 14 infusions of infliximab. The mean follow-up was 4.3 ± 2.8 months, and the total follow-up time was 195 patient-years. After 2061 infusions, 66 serious adverse events were reported (12.1%), 38 (6.9%) of them were infusion-related reactions. The biosimilar had to be stopped in 29 (5.3%) cases for severe infusion reactions (8 naive, 19 previous exposed, and 2 switch), and in further 16 patients (2.9%) for other serious adverse events. Infusion reactions were significantly more frequent in patients pre-exposed to infliximab than to other anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (incidence rate ratio = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.05-7.9). The efficacy of the biosimilar was evaluated in 434 patients who received treatment for at least 8 weeks, using time-to-event methods for censored observations: 35 patients were primary failures (8.1%). After further 8, 16, and 24 weeks, the efficacy estimations were 95.7%, 86.4%, and 73.7% for naive, 97.2%, 85.2%, and 62.2% for pre-exposed, and 94.5%, 90.8%, and 78.9% for switch, respectively (log-rank P = 0.64).
Although no direct comparison was performed, preliminary data on efficacy and safety of CT-P13 were in line with those of infliximab.

Abstract 218. Title: Full Interchangeability in Regard to Immunogenicity Between the Infliximab Reference Biologic and Biosimilars CT-P13 and SB2 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29462398
Abstract: Infliximab (IFX) biosimilars CT-P13 and SB2 have comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to the originator Remicade (RMC). However, concerns about cross-switching patients between the 3 brands were raised in the absence of cross reactivity data between them. We aimed to determine whether antibodies to infliximab (ATI) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients cross-react with RMC, CT-P13, and SB2.
Based on previous ATI status, samples from 34 patients participating in the BIOSIM01 study (13 RMC, 9 CT-P13, and 12 switchers) were selected. Patients were treated with either RMC only, or CT-P13 only, or with RMC switched to CT-P13. Additionally, 28 IFX-naïve patients were assayed as controls. In total, 180 samples were analyzed. ATI trough levels were measured in parallel with 3 different bridging Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays constructed using the 3 drugs. Spearman's coefficient and percentages of agreement were used to study the correlation between each assay.
In total, 76 samples out of 152 IFX-treated patient samples were ATI-positive (30 RMC, 14 CT-P13, and 32 switchers). All resulted ATI-positive when either CT-P13 or SB2 bridging assays were used. The overall percentage of agreement was 100% when compared either with CT-P13 or SB2 assays. No significant differences were found among ATI levels and coefficients (Spearman's 0.98 to 1.0, P < 0.0001).
ATI of RMC-treated, CT-P13-treated or RMC to CT-P13 switched patients show full cross-reactivity with CT-P13 and SB2. Findings suggest that immunodominant epitopes in the reference and CT-P13 drugs are equally present in SB2. Data support full interchangeability between biosimilars in regard to immunogenicity.

Abstract 219. Title: Long-term effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of the biosimilar SB2 in inflammatory bowel disease patients after switching from originator infliximab.
Publication Date: 2021-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33505519
Abstract: Long-term data on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients switched from originator to biosimilar infliximab SB2 are lacking. The aim of the conducted study was to investigate the effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of a large prospectively followed-up IBD patient cohort that was entirely switched from originator infliximab to biosimilar SB2 treatment.
This was a prospective, single-center, longitudinal, observational study describing clinical outcomes in IBD patients, over an 80-week period following switch from originator infliximab to SB2. Primary outcome measures were change of disease activity [Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease (CD), partial Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis (UC)], C-reactive protein (CRP), infliximab trough levels (TLs), anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and adverse events.
One hundred and forty-four IBD patients (94 CD, 50 UC), with median duration of 30.5 months' (range 2-110) treatment with originator infliximab were evaluated. Mean change of disease activity compared with baseline was -0.9 (SD 2.6), -0.4 (2.2) and -0.4 (2.0) in CD; 0.1 (1.1), 0.1 (1.1) and 0.1 (1.3) in UC patients at weeks 24, 48 and 72. Median infliximab TLs were 6.2 µg/ml (interquartile range 2.3-12.2), 5.0 µg/ml (2.7-10.0), 6.6 µg/ml (3.5-12.4) and 5.1 µg/ml (2.7-10.9) at baseline and weeks 24, 48 and 72. Median CRP levels were within normal ranges throughout the study. After the switch, 9.8% of the patients developed new ADAs. Persistence on SB2 was 90% (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.95), 79% (0.72-0.86), 72% (0.64-0.80) at weeks 26, 52 and 78. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 patients.
Over the individual patient follow-up of 80 weeks, switch to biosimilar SB2 from originator infliximab does not result in increased disease activity or changed immunogenicity patterns. The switch to SB2 was well tolerated.

Abstract 220. Title: Rapid monitoring of health services utilization following a shift in coverage from brand name to biosimilar drugs in British Columbia-An interim report.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32463156
Abstract: We explored changes in health services utilization associated with the Biosimilars Initiative introduced in British Columbia on May 27, 2019. To maintain drug coverage, the policy requires users of originator infliximab or etanercept to transition to biosimilar versions. We present a three-month interim analysis of this initiative.
We conducted a rapid monitoring analysis to evaluate changes in health services utilization three months after the policy was introduced compared with a three-year period before the policy's introduction. Using the administrative claims data of the British Columbia Ministry of Health, we assembled three historical cohorts and one policy cohort of users of each originator drug (8 cohorts in total). Cumulative incidences of medication refills, switching, and visits to physicians were the outcome measures used to compare policy and historical cohorts. Likelihood ratios were used to quantify statistical differences between each policy cohort and its respective historical controls. Likelihood ratios above 7.1 were considered statistically significant.
The four infliximab cohorts included 436 patients on average, mean age 56 to 59, 53% to 55% females. The four etanercept cohorts included 1826 patients on average, mean age 57 to 58, 60% to 63% females. Three months after the policy's introduction, 21% of patients treated in the policy cohorts transitioned to the biosimilar versions. Health services utilization in the policy cohorts were consistent with the historical cohorts.
An increase in visits to physicians was expected but not detected in the first three months of the Biosimilars Initiative. The impacts of the policy will continue to be monitored.

Abstract 221. Title: Nonmedical Switching From Originators to Biosimilars: Does the Nocebo Effect Explain Treatment Failures and Adverse Events in Rheumatology and Gastroenterology?
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31950442
Abstract: The act of nonmedical switching, defined as switching stable patients who are generally doing well with their current therapy from an originator biologic to its biosimilar, has been endorsed as a reasonable treatment strategy. The safety and efficacy of nonmedical switching have been evaluated in randomized controlled and real-world evidence studies, which have demonstrated that although many patients maintain treatment response after the switch, some patients experience therapy failure, resulting in therapy discontinuation. It has been postulated that the vast majority, if not all, of these treatment failures result from a "nocebo effect", defined as patients' negative expectations toward the therapy change. Reports suggest that the risk of a nocebo effect is higher following a mandated nonmedical switch. Although the nocebo effect is a well-recognized phenomenon in pain studies, evidence is limited in immune-mediated diseases primarily because it is difficult to quantify, especially retrospectively. In spite of this, numerous biosimilar studies in patients with immune-mediated diseases have concluded that nonmedical switching failures are due to a nocebo effect. The objective of this narrative review was to explore the reasons for nonmedical switch failure or discontinuation and the role of the nocebo effect among patients with inflammatory rheumatic and gastrointestinal diseases who switched from an originator biologic to its biosimilar.

Abstract 222. Title: Switching From Originator to Biosimilar Human Growth Hormone Using Dialogue Teamwork: Single-Center Experience From Sweden.
Publication Date: 2013-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24392303
Abstract: A new treatment plan was implemented at Skåne University Hospital, on economic grounds, for children requiring recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. This involved switching patients from treatment with originator rhGHs to treatment with a biosimilar rhGH, somatropin (Omnitrope<sup>®</sup>), using a Dialogue Teamwork approach. The feasibility of using this approach to implement the switch of treatment was assessed, as well as the impact of the switch on treatment efficacy and cost of therapy.
As part of the Dialogue Teamwork approach, patients/parents received several opportunities for dialogue and sources of information, including discussions with the Head of Department, the responsible physician and a specialized endocrinology nurse. Height and height standard deviation score (HSDS) data were plotted for each individual patient (<i>N</i> = 98). A modeling approach was also used, to predict growth after switching to biosimilar rhGH; the predictions were then compared to the actual observed height after the switch. Costs to the clinic of rhGH therapy were calculated between May-August 2009 and May-August 2012.
Of the 102 patients offered the switch, 98 accepted. Height and HSDS data indicated there was no negative impact on growth velocity after the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Modeling demonstrated that observed growth following the switch was consistent with predicted growth based on data before patients were switched. There were no reports of serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions following the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Following the switch, the cost to the clinic of rhGH treatment decreased from approximately 6 million SEK (May-August 2009) to approximately 4 million SEK (May-August 2012). This corresponds to an annual saving of 6 million SEK (€650,000).
Patients were successfully switched from originator to biosimilar rhGH (somatropin), with no negative impact on growth, and no serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions. The switch from originator to biosimilar rhGH is associated with substantial cost savings.

Abstract 223. Title: A survey of global biosimilar implementation practice conducted by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268828
Abstract: The International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners (ISOPP) Biosimilars Task Force was charged to develop educational activities and resources to assist members when implementing biosimilar medicines into their local practice. To facilitate the process, the task force conducted a survey in order to understand biosimilar implementation practice by ISOPP members across the world and the challenges that oncology pharmacists face when adopting biosimilars into their clinical practice.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20 April 2019 and 27 May 2019. Members of ISOPP and a number of national oncology pharmacy groups were invited to complete the survey. The survey contained 29 items and consisted of three sections: respondents’ demographics, respondents’ institutional practice relating to biosimilar implementation and post implementation practice at the respondents’ institutions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the survey results.
A total of 265 ISOPP members were surveyed, with 50 members providing a response (response rate = 19%). In addition, 40 nonmembers participated in the survey, bringing the total to 90 respondents. The most common factors that influence the decision to implement use of a biosimilar as reported by respondents are medication costs/pricing (92%), available clinical data (73%), and product availability (63%). Respondents also commented on the barriers to biosimilar implementation at their institutions, which included a reluctance of prescribers to use biosimilars (due to the lack of familiarity or perceived inferiority), a reluctance to switch established patients from an originator to a biosimilar and the preferences of insurance companies or funding bodies.
The results of this survey reinforce the need for greater education and training for health care professionals in the use of biosimilars, the importance of sharing good practice, and a need for standardization.

Abstract 224. Title: SB5: An Adalimumab Biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30251234
Abstract: SB5 (Imraldi<sup>®</sup>) is a biosimilar of the reference anti-TNF monoclonal antibody adalimumab. It is approved for use in the following indications for which reference adalimumab is approved: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis [polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)], axial spondyloarthritis [ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)], psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and non-infectious uveitis. SB5 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of these agents has been shown in healthy volunteers and patients with RA. SB5 demonstrated clinical efficacy considered equivalent to that of reference adalimumab in patients with RA, and was generally well tolerated in this population. The safety and tolerability profile of SB5 was similar to that of reference adalimumab, as was the immunogenicity profile. Switching from reference adalimumab to SB5 had no impact in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity. The role of reference adalimumab in the management of RA, pJIA, ERA, AS, nr-axSpA, PsA, psoriasis, pediatric plaque psoriasis, HS, Crohn's disease, UC and non-infectious uveitis is well established and SB5 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring adalimumab therapy.

Abstract 225. Title: Patients' information and perspectives on biosimilars in rheumatology: A French nation-wide survey.
Publication Date: 2019-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30659920
Abstract: To assess the patients' information about biosimilars and to identify the patients' incentives and deterrents to concur with the use of biosimilars.
Nation-wide cross-sectional study assessing information and concerns about biosimilars of French patients treated for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, whether they were treated or not by a biological DMARD. The assessment was available online from March to July 2017.
Among the 629 respondents, 43% knew what biosimilars were. The main sources of information were rheumatologists and patient associations. Among patients treated with a biosimilar, 44% were not informed before they received the treatment. The patients' concerns focused on the non-similar molecular structure (46%), efficacy (60%) and safety (57%) comparatively to the originator biologic. 15% of respondents would refuse to switch their biologic to its biosimilar. More than 50% of respondents would warily accept to switch medications and interrupt the treatment if in doubt. Being informed about biosimilars and a good understanding of the definition of biosimilars were characteristics associated with better adherence to biosimilars. The rheumatologist was considered the most influent source of information about biosimilars and was considered reliable when deciding to switch a biologic to its biosimilar. Patient were reluctant to substitution of the medications by pharmacists (2%). Medico-economical issues acted as an incentive and a deterrent to accept the switch of medication.
Biosimilars are largely unknown to patients. Information seems to be instrumental in improving the patients' adherence to biosimilars and could help preserving the therapeutic relationship and avoiding a nocebo effect.

Abstract 226. Title: A tale of two antibodies: obinutuzumab versus rituximab.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29741753
Abstract: While rituximab has dramatically improved outcomes for patients with CD20<sup>+</sup> malignancies for two decades, responses are not universal and resistance can develop. Obinutuzumab was developed to potentiate activity and overcome resistance. Pre-clinical data suggests obinutuzumab is superior to rituximab at effecting B cell depletion; however recent phase III clinical trial results have been mixed. The decision of which antibody to employ will probably be further complicated by the approval of a subcutaneous preparation of rituximab and several anti-CD20 biosimilars. Clinicians are now challenged with deciding whether to switch to obinutuzumab in approved settings, accepting the potential for increased toxicity and probable increased cost. The benefit conferred by obinutuzumab over rituximab may be context-specific and vary based on histological subtype and immune integrity. This comprehensive review will explore the preclinical differences, investigate the proposed pathogenesis of rituximab resistance, compare the employed dosing strategies and interrogate available clinical results to help inform practice.

Abstract 227. Title: CT-P13: design, development, and place in therapy.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28652703
Abstract: The introduction of biological agents has revolutionized the management of many life-threatening and debilitating immune-mediated diseases. Because of the high cost of biological drugs and their patent expiration, the market has opened to biosimilar agents, copy versions of the originators, which can lead to reduced health care expenditure and increase treatment access worldwide. CT-P13 is the first biosimilar of infliximab (IFX) and has been approved for the same indications as its originator drug. It obtained regulatory approval by the European Medicines Agency in September 2013 and by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2016. The Phase I and Phase III clinical trials conducted in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated pharmacokinetic and efficacy equivalence with comparable safety and immunogenicity to IFX. For these reasons, the use of CT-P13 has been extrapolated also to inflammatory bowel disease. There have been some initial concerns regarding the use of CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease patients, because of the lack of randomized controlled trials. However, emerging real-world data have further confirmed the comparability between CT-P13 and its reference product in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, in patients naïve to the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents and after switching from IFX, and will be summarized in this review.

Abstract 228. Title: Evaluation of Switching Patterns in FDA's Sentinel System: A New Tool to Assess Generic Drugs.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30120741
Abstract: Nearly 90% of drugs dispensed in the US are generic products.
The aim of this study was to develop and implement a tool for analyzing manufacturer-level drug utilization and switching patterns within the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel system.
A descriptive tool was designed to analyze data in the Sentinel common data model and was tested with two case studies-metoprolol extended release (ER) and lamotrigine ER-using claims data from four Sentinel data partners. We plotted initiators of each brand and generic product over time. For metoprolol ER, we evaluated rates of switching from generics around the time of manufacturing issues. For lamotrigine ER, we examined rates of switching back to the brand among those who switched from brand to generic.
We identified 1,651,285 initiators of metoprolol ER products between July 2008 and September 2015. We observed a large decrease in monthly metoprolol ER initiators (from 25,465 in December 2008 to 13,128 in February 2009), corresponding to recalls by generic manufacturers. We observed simultaneous increases in utilization of the authorized generic and brand products. We identified 4266 initiators of lamotrigine ER with an epilepsy diagnosis between January 2012 and September 2015. Among those who switched from brand to generic, the cumulative incidence of switching back was close to 20% at 2 years. Switchback rates were higher for the first available generic products.
This developed tool was able to elucidate novel utilization and switching patterns in two case studies. Such information can be used to support surveillance of generic drugs and biosimilars.

Abstract 229. Title: Dose equivalency and efficacy of biosimilar erythropoietin stimulating agents: Data from real clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524766
Abstract: Recently, biosimilar erythropoietin stimulating agents become available in Kazakhstan. Important properties of the biosimilar such as dose equivalency to the original medicine (originator) and the ability to maintain hemoglobin target levels remain insufficiently described in many clinical settings. Thus, the current study aims to determine dose equivalency and hemoglobin target levels in a cohort of dialysis patients who were switched from the originator to biosimilar. Retrospective data of 74 patients from different dialysis centers who received at least 6 months of originator and switched to biosimilar and had at least 6 months follow-up were analyzed. The clinical data of 32 male and 42 female patients were collected. The mean age was 52.5 ± 13.5 years. There is no significant difference in mean levels of hemoglobin during pre-switching from originator to biosimilar (6 months prior) and post switching period (9 months after). Additionally, a subgroup analysis of 59 patients who received originator (epoetin beta), 6 months before the switch, showed similar level of hemoglobin (110.7 ± 14 vs 113.2 ± 10 g/L, P = .05) 6 months after the switch to biosimilar (epoetin zeta) at the equivalent dose regimen (69.5 ± 29 vs 68.1 ± 30 IU/kg/wk, P = .55). However, after 9 months of switching, patients using lower doses of biosimilar (69.5 ± 29 vs 63.3 ± 30 IU/kg/wk, P < .01), showed significantly higher levels of hemoglobin (110.7 ± 14 vs 114.7 ± 8 g/L, P = .01) compared to preswitching period. In conclusion, long-term use of lower doses of biosimilar managed to maintain hemoglobin within the target levels.

Abstract 230. Title: Biosimilars: Concepts and controversies.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428205
Abstract: Biosimilars are copies of reference biological drugs, developed as the patents for original biologicals expire. They are thus developed to replicate an original biological medicine just a generics are intended to replicate a chemically-synthesized medicine; however, there are important technical and regulatory differences between the two. Unlike chemical drugs, molecular identity cannot generally be established for any two biological drugs. Accordingly, their pharmacological properties cannot be assumed to be the same. This is due to the complexity of the production of biologicals and to the presence of minor natural variations in the molecular structure (collectively known as microheterogeneity). Further, biological production yields slightly different versions of the drug over time, particularly when changes are introduced in the production process. In this case the prechange and postchange versions of the biological are analyzed in what is called a comparability exercise. The comparable versions thus validated are considered not to have any significant differences at the clinical level. Likewise, biosimilars are not identical copies but comparable versions of the original biological drug, also validated through a comparability exercise, although of a much broader scope. Although current knowledge about biosimilars has increased significantly, they still arise a number of controversies and misconceptions, particularly regarding issues like extrapolation of indications, immunogenicity and substitution. This review deals with concepts and controversies in the biosimilar field.

Abstract 231. Title: Cost Effectiveness of Secukinumab Versus Other Biologics and Apremilast in the Treatment of Active Psoriatic Arthritis in Germany.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701482
Abstract: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people affected by the autoimmune disease psoriasis. The cost effectiveness of secukinumab in PsA has not been evaluated in Germany.
The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis of secukinumab in three adult populations with active PsA in Germany: biologic naïve without moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, biologic naïve with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, and biologic experienced. Comparators included other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biosimilar versions as well as standard of care.
The analysis took the viewpoint of the German statutory health insurance. We adapted a decision analytic semi-Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of secukinumab over a lifetime horizon. Treatment response was assessed based on PsA Response Criteria at 12 weeks. Nonresponders or patients discontinuing the initial-line DMARD were allowed to switch to subsequent-line DMARDs. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and official reports. Health benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings was evaluated via sensitivity analyses.
In the biologic-naïve population without moderate or severe plaque psoriasis, secukinumab 150 mg either strictly dominated other DMARDs (certolizumab pegol, golimumab, and ustekinumab) or yielded favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (vs. etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab). In the biologic-naïve population with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and in the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab 300 mg was more effective and had a lower ICER than other DMARDs, thus leading to extended dominance. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the discount rate for costs and health outcomes as well as the HAQ score as an input to utility values.
Secukinumab appears to be cost effective compared with other DMARDs for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced populations in Germany.

Abstract 232. Title: The Regulation of Biosimilars in Latin America.
Publication Date: 2016-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26951254
Abstract: This article summarizes the regulatory scenario on biological medications in Latin America focusing on comparability studies, extrapolation of indications, interchangeability and pharmacovigilance issues. In the case of comparability studies, what is being discussed is the possibility of decreasing the clinical trials requirement, but that the molecule should be well characterized in the studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. With the worldwide-level approval of the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar, infliximab, extrapolation of indications are being discussed, since the behavior of the Latin America regulatory agencies has been different with regard to such issue. Another issue discussed by the regulatory agencies is the interchangeability between biological medications and their biosimilars, mainly due to the fact that there is a clear confusion on interchangeability and substitution concepts. Finally, the pharmacovigilance debate, according to what takes place globally, is related to the need for identifying and differentiating the reference biological medication and its biosimilars for traceability purposes.

Abstract 233. Title: Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28176515
Abstract: The introduction of biologic therapies has revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and has significantly improved the disease course and outcomes for many patients. Biologics are the main drivers of cost in many IBD units and biosimilars, although are not better than originators, are usually cheaper and thus can increase the availability of this type of therapy. Biosimilar are highly similar to innovator but, due to the complex structures of innovators and the variability inherent in the manufacturing process, they are no identical. This fact cause concerns with respect to the efficacy and safety in medical community, especially in the medical indications in which no specific clinical trials with biosimilars have been performed as IBD. Nowadays, two biosimilars to infliximab, CT-P13 and SB2, has been approved by European Medicines Agency in all the indications of the reference product. To date, the available evidence suggests that switch from reference medicinal product (infliximab) to the biosimilar (CT-P13 or SB2) is feasible since published studies have not observed significantly difference in terms of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety. However, the experts agreed that by now there is not sufficient evidence to consider infliximab biosimilars interchangeable with the originator compound. In this manuscript, we will review the processes involved in the manufacturing and regulatory approval of biosimilars and examine the evidence presently available on approved biosimilars in Europe for IBD.

Abstract 234. Title: The evolving role of biosimilars in haematology-oncology: a practical perspective.
Publication Date: 2015-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622996
Abstract: The loss of patents covering many biopharmaceutical/biological agents in the mid 1990s led to the introduction of a new generation of drugs: biosimilars. These new agents, produced by living cells just as the originator drugs, are chemically highly similar to endogenous human proteins; characterized by three-dimensionally complex, high molecular weight compounds. Among the first biosimilars used in haematology-oncology were erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After five years of use in clinical practice, the efficacy and safety profile of biosimilars approved by the European Medicines Agency is excellent. Over the next year or two, biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) will become available; the first will be rituximab and trastuzumab. Not only are MoAbs more complex in terms of molecular weight and number of amino acids than the first biosimilars, but they are also anticancer drugs, not merely supportive treatments like their predecessors. This opens up important questions. How are regulatory agencies to assess their clinical efficacy, immunogenicity and safety? Is the neoadjuvant clinical setting the best to evaluate them? What will regulatory agencies decide in terms of switching an originator molecule for a biosimilar or extrapolating efficacy results from one pathology to another? Once biosimilars of rituximab and trastuzumab are approved, several challenging issues will need to be addressed such as how to maintain appropriate pharmacovigilance, how to extrapolate across indications, and issues concerning automatic substitution. There is currently no consensus in any of these areas. This review addresses all these issues: new challenges that the oncology community will face in the near future.

Abstract 235. Title: Effects of Message Framing on Patients' Perceptions and Willingness to Change to a Biosimilar in a Hypothetical Drug Switch.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31233269
Abstract: Patients often hold negative perceptions toward biosimilars that can create barriers to their uptake. Physicians also report uncertainty in how best to explain biosimilars. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of differently framed explanations on patients' perceptions of and willingness to change to a biosimilar in a hypothetical drug switch.
Ninety-six patients with rheumatic diseases taking an originator biologic were randomized to receive 1 of 4 biosimilar explanations: positive framing with and without an analogy, and negative framing with and without an analogy. Willingness to switch to a biosimilar, perceptions about biosimilars, and the effectiveness of the explanation were measured after the information delivery.
Positive framing led to more participants being willing to switch (67%) than negative framing (46%). Framing significantly predicted willingness to switch to a biosimilar, with participants in the positive framing group being 2.36 times more willing to switch (P = 0.041). The positive framing group also reported significantly greater perceived efficacy of biosimilars (P = 0.046) and thought the explanation was more convincing (P = 0.030). The analogy did not enhance willingness to switch or increase understanding (P > 0.05).

Abstract 236. Title: Patients' beliefs and behaviours are associated with perceptions of safety and concerns in a hypothetical biosimilar switch.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32300866
Abstract: Although patient acceptance is important for biosimilar adoption and reducing healthcare costs, many patients perceive biosimilars to be unsafe and have concerns about switching. Studies show that patients' characteristics influence negative perceptions toward generic drugs, but little research has explored biosimilar acceptance. This study examines which demographic and psychological characteristics are associated with patients' safety perceptions and concerns about switching to biosimilars. Ninety-six patients taking bio-originators for rheumatic conditions (65% for rheumatoid arthritis) completed the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire and Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines Scale. Demographic factors, information seeking, concerns about switching and safety perceptions were also assessed. Pearson's correlations and hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to explore whether patient characteristics are associated with perceptions of biosimilars. Negative safety perceptions were associated with being female, short-term bio-originator use, illness beliefs, seeking health information online, high perceived sensitivity to medicines and negative beliefs about medicines. Only being female (β = 0.24, P = 0.02) was independently associated. More concerns about switching were associated with being female, illness beliefs, high perceived sensitivity to medicines, information-seeking behaviours and preferring innovator drugs. Seeking health information online (β = 0.20, P = 0.04), preferring innovator drugs (β = 0.29, P = 0.004) and stronger emotional responses (β = 0.26, P = 0.01) were independently associated. Perceived bio-originator effectiveness was inversely associated with preferring biosimilars (r<sub>s</sub>=  - 0.33, P < 0.001). Patients who have stronger emotional responses to their condition, are females, seek health information online and prefer innovator drugs that have more negative perceptions about biosimilars. Experiences with bio-originators influence attitudes towards switching.

Abstract 237. Title: Biosimilars for inflammatory bowel disease: how can healthcare professionals help address patients' concerns?
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30791783
Abstract: The patent expiration of some biologics used in chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has led to the development of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. The tailored regulatory approval route for biosimilar development ensures that approved biosimilars show similarity to their originators in terms of efficacy and safety, and avoids unnecessary repetition of clinical trials carried out with the originator product. However, some patients may still have concerns about using biosimilars and it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals (HCPs) to alleviate these concerns. Areas covered: This review highlights clinical and real-world evidence supporting efficacy and safety of biosimilars in patients with IBD. Moreover, based on international surveys, potential patient concerns are highlighted, along with possible actions HCPs can take to address these concerns. Expert commentary: The rising use of biosimilars in IBD is expected to have a positive impact on the availability of biologics and healthcare costs. Several biosimilars have been approved for use and more are likely to come to the market in the future; however, transitioning patients to biosimilars could pose an unexpected challenge without the help and support of HCPs.

Abstract 238. Title: FKB327, an adalimumab biosimilar, versus the reference product: results of a randomized, Phase III, double-blind study, and its open-label extension.
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-12
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31831079
Abstract: To compare the efficacy, serum drug concentrations, immunogenicity, and safety of FKB327 with the adalimumab reference product (RP) in combination with methotrexate in patients with moderate-to-severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Patients were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind study (NCT02260791), received 40 mg of FKB327 or RP by subcutaneous injection every other week for 24 weeks (Period I), then re-randomized 2:1, remaining on the same study drug or switching to the other up to week 54 in an open-label extension (Period II, NCT02405780). Efficacy was evaluated using American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response rate difference at week 24 with equivalence margins of ± 13% and - 12% to + 15% using 95% and 90% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. Efficacy, serum drug concentrations, immunogenicity, and safety were compared at week 54.
A total of 730 patients were randomized in Period I (n = 367 FKB327, n = 363 RP), and 645 transitioned to Period II (n = 216 FKB327-FKB327, n = 108 FKB327-RP, n = 108 RP-FKB327, n = 213 RP-RP). At week 24, ACR20 response rates were 74.1% with FKB327 versus 75.7% with RP. 95% and 90% CI of the response rate difference were - 7.9 to 4.7% and - 7.3 to 3.6%, respectively, meeting predefined equivalence margins. The ACR20 response rate remained over 70% of patients to week 54 with all treatment sequences. In Period I, mean trough serum drug concentrations were slightly higher for patients receiving FKB327 than those receiving RP. Mean concentrations were stable over time and reflected steady state in Period II. The proportions of patients with samples positive for neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were comparable (57.7% with FKB327 vs. 55.5% with RP) at week 24, and no consistent difference in ADA were seen between continuous and switched treatments in Period II. Efficacy was slightly reduced in the small proportion of patients with high ADA titers in all treatment groups. No clinically significant differences were observed in the incidence of commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events between the treatments across Periods I and II.
FKB327 was equivalent to RP in clinical efficacy and demonstrated comparable safety and immunogenicity in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. No effect of switching between FKB327 and RP was observed.

Abstract 239. Title: Long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy comparing FKB327 with the adalimumab reference product in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: data from randomised double-blind and open-label extension studies.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371430
Abstract: FKB327 is a biosimilar of the antitumour necrosis factor adalimumab reference product (RP). A randomised, double-blind (DB) phase 3 study compared the efficacy of FKB327 with the RP in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inadequately controlled with methotrexate (MTX). A subsequent randomised open-label extension (OLE) study with treatment switching assessed long-term safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of FKB327 compared with the RP.
Patients with moderate-to-severe, active RA on a stable dose of MTX were randomised 1:1 to receive FKB327 or the RP (40 mg subcutaneously every other week) for 24 weeks. Patients who completed the DB study were enrolled in the OLE and rerandomised 2:1 to receive FKB327 or the RP; two-thirds continued on the same treatment and one-third switched for 30 weeks. All patients received FKB327 through Week 76. Long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed.
Of 728 patients in the DB study, 645 were enrolled in the FKB327-OLE study. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rates for all treatment groups at Week 30 in the OLE ranged from 83.2% to 85.9%. ACR20 response rates remained stable for all patients regardless of single- or double-switching treatment and were similar for all treatment sequences through Week 76. The safety profile and incidence of antidrug antibodies were comparable across sequences.
Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were similar among patients with RA treated with FKB327 or the RP for up to 2 years, and were not affected by single- or double-switching treatment.

Abstract 240. Title: Biosimilars in Dermatology - theory becomes reality.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29364594
Abstract: Biosimilars are biological medicines that are analogues of a specific reference product. Biosimilars of the tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors infliximab and etanercept are already approved and available for dermatological indications. Regulatory agencies require in-depth analysis of physicochemical and functional properties of these highly complex molecules as well as clinical data on their similarity regarding efficacy and safety in at least one clinical trial in a sensitive and homogeneous population. Thus, it must be shown that biosimilars are essentially the same as the originator product if they are to be licensed in regulated drug markets. As a consequence, these data are extrapolated from one molecule (the originator) to another (biosimilar) resulting in an approval that includes the same indications as the originator product. While extrapolation is well accepted and regulated, clear recommendations regarding the interchangeability of originators and biosimilars as well as data on multiple consecutive switching are missing. Current scientific knowledge does not argue against the use of biosimilars for dermatological indications, but sequential switching of biosimilars should be considered carefully. To increase confidence and enhance evidence for biosimilars, accurate documentation of the specific products given to each patient is essential and should preferably be included in patient registries.

Abstract 241. Title: Biosimilars in der Dermatologie - Theorie wird Realität.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29418106
Abstract: Biosimilars sind biologische Medikamente, bei denen es sich um Nachbildungen eines spezifischen Referenzprodukts handelt. Biosimilars der Tumornekrosefaktor-alpha-Inhibitoren Infliximab und Etanercept sind bereits zugelassen und stehen für dermatologische Indikationen zur Verfügung. Die Aufsichtsbehörden verlangen eine eingehende Analyse der physikochemischen und funktionellen Eigenschaften dieser hochkomplexen Moleküle sowie klinische Daten hinsichtlich ihrer gleichwertigen Wirksamkeit und Sicherheit anhand mindestens einer klinischen Studie mit einer sensitiven und homogenen Population. Für die Zulassung in einem regulierten Arzneimittelmarkt muss daher nachgewiesen werden, dass die Biosimilars praktisch gleichwertig mit dem jeweiligen Originalpräparat sind. Demzufolge werden diese Daten von einem Molekül (dem Originator) auf das andere (das Biosimilar) extrapoliert und die resultierende Zulassung umfasst die gleichen Indikationen wie beim Originalpräparat. Die Extrapolation ist zwar gut akzeptiert und reguliert, es fehlen jedoch klare Empfehlungen hinsichtlich der Austauschbarkeit von Originator und Biosimilar ebenso wie Daten über mehrmalige aufeinanderfolgende Umstellungen. Die aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse stehen einer Anwendung von Biosimilars bei dermatologischen Indikationen nicht entgegen. Eine mehrmalige Umstellung der Biosimilars sollte jedoch sorgfältig überdacht werden. Um das Vertrauen in Biosimilars zu festigen und ihre Evidenz zu verbessern, ist es essentiell das spezifische Produkt, das jeder Patient erhält, möglichst genau und möglichst im Rahmen von Patientenregister zu dokumentieren.

Abstract 242. Title: Multiple switches between GP2015, an etanercept biosimilar, with originator product do not impact efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis: 30-week results from the phase 3, confirmatory EGALITY study.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28960486
Abstract: EGALITY was a phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study conducted in patients with plaque-type psoriasis as a part of totality of evidence gathered during the development of GP2015, an etanercept biosimilar.
To demonstrate equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and the etanercept originator product (ETN, Enbrel<sup>®</sup> ) and evaluate effects of repeated switching between GP2015 and ETN. Results for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity during treatment period (TP) 2 (TP2) are presented pooling the two continued treatment arms (pooled continued) versus the two treatment arms with repeated switches (pooled switched).
Patients (n = 531) were randomized 1:1 to self-administer GP2015 or ETN twice-weekly subcutaneously during TP1. Patients with a ≥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were re-randomized for TP2 to continue the same treatment at once-weekly dosing or to undergo three consecutive treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Patients continued the last-assigned treatment during TP2, until week 52.
Mean (standard deviation [SD]) PASI scores at baseline were similar in patients who underwent multiple switches compared to those with continued treatments during TP2. During TP2, PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 response rates, percent change from baseline in PASI scores and all other efficacy parameters were similar between the pooled switched and pooled continued treatment groups at all time points. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events including injection site reactions was comparable between the pooled switched (36.7%) and pooled continued (34.9%) groups. None of the patients in either treatment group were positive for binding anti-drug antibodies in TP2.
Treatment efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were similar between the pooled continued and pooled switched treatments during TP2, indicating that there are no effects in the short term on clinical data of multiple switches between GP2015 and ETN.

Abstract 243. Title: Switching From Originator to Biosimilar Infliximab in Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Is Feasible and Uneventful.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29985877
Abstract: The safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of biosimilar infliximab in adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have now been extensively shown. Limited data have been collected in the paediatric setting. We report nationwide, prospective, clinical safety and effectiveness data for patients from all 3 Scottish paediatric inflammatory bowel disease networks switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab. Prospective clinical data were collected for 33 patients. Information was collected from electronic patient records, laboratory reports, and patient case notes. There were no clinically significant changes to disease activity, biomarkers, antidrug antibodies, or trough drug levels (P > 0.1) within a 12-month follow-up period; in addition, there were no significant adverse events reported. No infusion reactions were seen in the 264 infusions delivered. Switching from originator infliximab to the biosimilar (CT-P13) appears to be associated with neither an increase in infusion reactions nor significant loss of effectiveness in the short term.

Abstract 244. Title: Economic Evaluation of Sequences of Biological Treatments for Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response or Intolerance to Methotrexate in France.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327163
Abstract: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are prescribed sequentially in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Healthcare decision makers continue to debate their use, mainly because of their high costs. Our aim was to perform an economic evaluation for France of bDMARD sequences for treatment of moderate-to-severe RA after inadequate response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs (eg, methotrexate).
A discretely integrated condition event simulation was developed to track the course of patients from first bDMARD through switches to further lines in a sequence. The model included 11 events, 91 conditions, and 21 controlling equations. Inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials, a French registry, national drug lists, and databases. Survival, time with minimal activity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs were output. Structural and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Sequences starting with etanercept biosimilars (ETB) cost less, with ETB-abatacept-infliximab the least expensive: the mean lifetime discounted total cost was €116 912 per patient, with a mean of 11.166 QALYs. Most other strategies were dominated or led to small QALY gains (0.0008-0.0329). Only ETB-tocilizumab-abatacept made it onto the efficiency frontier, but at €955 778 per QALY gained. These results were confirmed in several scenarios and uncertainty analyses.
Given minor differences in QALYs gained between bDMARD sequences with large cost differences, starting with biosimilars was more efficient than starting with branded products. Our model and findings should provide French and other decision makers with useful tools to address the challenges of comparing sequences of treatments for RA.

Abstract 245. Title: US rheumatologists' beliefs and knowledge about biosimilars: a survey.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146388
Abstract: We sought to evaluate perceptions of biosimilar products among US rheumatologists who prescribe TNF-α inhibitors, given that 10 TNF-α inhibitor biosimilars and two rituximab biosimilars have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.
A 19-question self-administered online survey was conducted from 6 May to 1 June 2019, and fielded by WebMD, LLC. Rheumatologists (n = 9050) who were members of Medscape.com and its partner panels were invited to participate. Likert and other rating scales were used to collect responses, which were summarized descriptively.
Responses were obtained from 320 board-certified US rheumatologists, 85% of whom were fellows of the ACR. Nearly all respondents were familiar with the FDA definition of a biosimilar product and were aware that an infliximab biosimilar was FDA approved; fewer realized that adalimumab, etanercept and rituximab biosimilars were also FDA approved. Most respondents (84%) were aware that an approved biosimilar was not automatically deemed interchangeable by the FDA. Rheumatologists were more likely to initiate biosimilar treatment for a biologic treatment-naïve patient with RA (73%) than they were to switch to the biosimilar for a patient with RA doing well on the reference product (35%).
The results of this survey suggest that US rheumatologists have a good understanding and acceptance of biosimilar products, particularly for the initiation of treatment in biologic-naïve individuals. They were hesitant to switch from a reference product to a biosimilar for a patient doing well on the reference product. Additional education on biosimilars is required to help inform treatment decisions by rheumatologists. A plain language summary of this article has been uploaded as supplementary material, available at Rheumatology online.

Abstract 246. Title: Combining Therapeutic Drug Monitoring with Biosimilars, a Strategy to Improve the Efficacy of Biologicals for Treating Inflammatory Bowel Diseases at an Affordable Cost.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28147368
Abstract: Biologicals provide a tight disease control but not all patients respond favourably to treatment. Some patients do not respond at all (primary non-responders), while other patients respond initially but show loss of response over time (secondary non-responders). Drug concentrations in the serum of patients can be monitored and correlated with biological, clinical or endoscopic response. Therapeutic thresholds have been defined for infliximab and adalimumab. The European Medicines Agency has approved 3 biosimilars of infliximab and new biosimilars are waiting approval. Key Messages: Distinguishing primary non-responders from patients with insufficient drug exposure during induction through drug serum concentration determination will improve drug efficacy. Current algorithms to guide treatment of patients with secondary loss of response take into account that patients with high titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) do not respond to dose intensification and that patients with therapeutic drug concentrations cannot be switched to biologicals within class. For patients in clinical remission, the cost of biological treatment can be decreased by dose tapering patients with supra-therapeutic concentrations and/or by switching patients with adequate drug concentrations and no formation of ADA to biosimilar, whereas efficacy can be increased by dose-intensifying patients with low or transient ADA and by switching patients with persistent ADA to biologicals within or out-off class.
As an objective tool, therapeutic drug monitoring can identify patients who are eligible for dose tapering, intensification of treatment, cessation of treatment, switching within- or out-of-class and switching to biosimilar.

Abstract 247. Title: Bioequivalence studies with anti-TNF biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30574813
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Biosimilars, as defined by the European Medicines Agency, have been used in Europe since 2006. The landscape was considerably expanded when the first biosimilar of a monoclonal was approved and introduced in the European market. CT-P13 was developed by Celltrion as an infliximab biosimilar in 2013, not without controversy. As these complex molecules cannot be completely identical, some experts, clinicians, and even patients were skeptical regarding the real bioequivalence of the drugs. Currently, several new infliximab and adalimumab biosimilars are available or will reach the market in a few months. <b>Areas covered</b>: Our goal is to review, mainly from a clinical perspective, the available evidence for bioequivalence of anti-TNF biosimilars. We aim to take into account not only preclinical studies, mostly done for regulatory issues, but also data from clinical studies. <b>Expert opinion</b>: We can conclude that bioequivalence with originator is well demonstrated in those drugs which have followed European Medicines Agency regulatory pathways. Switching from originator to biosimilar appears safe for all indications. However, there are few data available for switching from one biosimilar to another, or for complete interchangeability. Prospective studies and strict pharmacovigilance are recommended.

Abstract 248. Title: Switching from an originator anti-TNF to a biosimilar in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: Can it be recommended? A systematic review.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29753532
Abstract: To review the effectiveness and safety of switching from an originator anti-TNF (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) to a biosimilar (CT-P13) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Electronic and manual search up to September 2017.
We identified 24 studies evaluating switching between Remicade<sup>®</sup> and CT-P13 in 1326 patients. Disease control (no worsening after switching) was confirmed in most of the patients (weighted mean, 88%; 95% CI=86-89%). No unexpected adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.
The risks of switching from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to a biosimilar seem to be purely theoretical and are not supported by the (still limited) real-world clinical practice experience. On the contrary, a steadily increasing number of publications have shown that there seem to be no safety or efficacy concerns about switching. Therefore, switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab in patients with IBD may be considered acceptable.

Abstract 249. Title: TNF-α inhibitors biosimilars as first line systemic treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32419534
Abstract: Biologics have revolutionized the therapy of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Despite their greater efficacy over conventional systemic therapies their high cost has represented a burden for health-care systems, which limited their use. The availability of biosimilars at low cost is changing the place in therapy of biologics for psoriasis.
The role of TNF- α inhibitors in the management of plaque psoriasis, their efficacy and safety profile are presented. Phase 3 clinical trials and real-life data from the use of TNF- α inhibitor biosimilars in the treatment of plaque psoriasis are also reviewed in detail. Furthermore, arguments in favor of the use of TNF- α inhibitor biosimilars as a first-line therapy in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are discussed.
An increasing amount of data show that biosimilars represent a safe and effective alternative to the originator biologics. In the face of ever-increasing health-care costs, switching to biosimilars and starting naïve patients on the best-value biologic can reduce expenditure for patients and payers while maintaining a high-quality care. Moreover, as the cost of biosimilars is approaching the cost of conventional systemic treatments, TNF-α inhibitors biosimilars may represent a first-line systemic treatment for psoriasis patients because they are effective and safe.

Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30962961
Abstract: Biosimilars can potentially improve the sustainability of cancer care; however, uptake is sometimes limited by safety concerns and a lack of understanding of the concept of extrapolation. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conducted a survey to assess the current level of knowledge, understanding and comfort of use of biosimilars among prescribers specialised in oncology.
A 19-question survey was developed using the SurveyMonkey online platform (https://www.surveymonkey.com/). Data collection occurred between September and October 2017 and included paper and online responses.
Overall, 393 responses were received from prescribers. Overall, 49.0% of prescribers use biosimilars in clinical practice and most (79.2%) rate their general knowledge of biosimilars as average to very high. Potential increased risk of immunogenicity remains a significant concern of switching. Gaps in knowledge identified by the survey include biosimilar development, clinical trial design and endpoint selection, and requirements for extrapolation, which should form the focus of future educational initiatives. A substantial demand remains for further educational activities with equal preference for online and face-to-face initiatives. A higher rate of biosimilar use (56.3% vs 46.5%), knowledge of biosimilar development and trial design, and comfort with extrapolation, but a lower knowledge of European Medicines Agency definitions, was found among prescribers from Asia-Pacific versus those from Europe.
Encouraging levels of prescriber use and general knowledge of biosimilars were found, but a substantial need for further education remains. Efforts should be made worldwide to align terms, definitions and guidelines for the development and approval of biosimilars.

Abstract 251. Title: Does a mandatory non-medical switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept lead to increase in healthcare use and costs? A Danish register-based study of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31452931
Abstract: In year 2016, Danish national guidelines included a mandatory switch of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated with originator etanercept (ETA) to biosimilar SB4 in routine care. We aimed to explore if switching lead to increased healthcare utilisation and costs.
Observational cohort study. Adult patients who switched from ETA to SB4 were identified in the Danish nationwide DANBIO registry. In the National Patient Registry, we identified health utilisation (hospital admissions/hospital days/outpatient visits/prescription medication use) and comorbidities. Estimation of health utilisation included average use and costs 1 year before/after switch, changes after the switch, and whether patient characteristics affected changes. Analyses were by adjusted two-step gamma distributed regression models, and for changes over time a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model was applied. Impact of comorbidities was explored as interaction terms in the model. Medication costs of ETA and SB4 were not included in model.
1620 patients were included (mean age 55 years (SD 14.7), 40% male). Costs before and after switching were mainly driven by outpatient visits (67%/72% of all costs). Monthly fluctuations of costs were similar before/after switch. After switching, use (8%) and costs (7%) of outpatient services increased, whereas costs of admissions (55%) and medication (5%) decreased. Patients with longer ETA treatment duration had an increase in use and costs of healthcare resources, whereas gender and comorbidities had no impact. Higher age was associated with an increase in costs of inpatient services.
We demonstrated no obvious changes in overall use and costs of healthcare services following switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept.

Abstract 252. Title: A nationwide non-medical switch from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 in 802 patients with inflammatory arthritis: 1-year clinical outcomes from the DANBIO registry.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28473425
Abstract: According to guidelines, a nationwide non-medical switch from originator (INX, Remicade) to biosimilar infliximab (Remsima, CT-P13) was conducted in Danish patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). We investigated disease activity before/after switching and retention rates in the DANBIO registry.
Disease activities 3 months before and after switch and changes over time were calculated. Flare was defined as change in 28 Joint Disease Activity Score (∆DAS28) ≥1.2 (RA/PsA) or Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (∆ASDAS) ≥1.3 (AxSpA). Crude and adjusted retention rates were compared with a historic cohort of INX-treated patients.
Eight hundred and two patients switched (403 RA/120 PsA/279 AxSpA; 51% women, age (median (IQR): 55 (44-66)) years). Follow-up was 413 (339-442) days. Prior INX treatment duration was 6.8 (4.3-9.5) years. Disease activities were similar 3 months before/after switch. Crude 1-year CT-P13 retention rate (84.1 (95% CI 81.3 to 86.5)) was similar to the historic IFX cohort (86.2 (95% CI 84.0 to 88.0), p=0.22). The adjusted absolute retention rates were 83.4 (95% CI 80.8 to 86.2) and 86.8% (95% CI 84.8 to 88.8), respectively (p=0.03). In total 132 patients withdrew (lack of effect: 71/132=54%, adverse events: 37/132=28%). Patients with previous INX treatment duration >5 years had longer CT-P13 retention.
In 802 arthritis patients treated with INX for median >6 years, a nationwide non-medical switch to CT-P13 had no negative impact on disease activity. Adjusted 1-year CT-P13 retention rate was slightly lower than for INX in a historic cohort.

Abstract 253. Title: Does a mandatory non-medical switch from originator to biosimilar infliximab lead to increased use of outpatient healthcare resources? A register-based study in patients with inflammatory arthritis.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30018807
Abstract: National Danish guidelines in May 2015 dictated a mandatory switch from originator infliximab (INX) to biosimilar CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease. We investigated if this non-medical switch changed use of outpatient hospital resources.
Observational cohort study. Switchers were identified in DANBIO. Rheumatic outpatient contacts, visits and services were identified in the National Patient Registry. The 6-month rate for (1) number of visits (or services) and (2) days with ≥1 visit (or service) were compared before/after switching (paired t-tests). Visits per week per patient before/after the switch date were analysed with graphical interrupted time-series analysis.
In 769 switchers (372 males, median age 54 years (IQR 44-66)), 1484 outpatient contacts, 6718 visits and 9243 days with services (693 on switch date) were identified. Mean visit rate was 3.89 before and 3.95 after switch (p=0.35). Total number of services was 19 752 (2019 on switch date). Mean rates before/after switch for 16 service categories were small and differences close to zero. Visits per week per patient appeared similar before/after switch with peaks every ≈8 weeks (standard INX infusion interval).
Changes were marginal with no clinically relevant increase in use of outpatient health care resources 6 months after compared with 6 months before mandatory switch from originator to biosimilar infliximab.

Abstract 254. Title: Cost-effectiveness analysis of secukinumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis: a Canadian perspective.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28945143
Abstract: The study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin (IL)-17A, vs currently licensed biologic treatments in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from a Canadian healthcare system perspective.
A decision analytic semi-Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg compared to subcutaneous biologics adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and ustekinumab, and intravenous biologics infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients over a lifetime horizon. The response to treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings were evaluated via sensitivity analyses.
Biologic-naive patients treated with secukinumab achieved the highest number of QALYs (8.54) at the lowest cost (CAD 925,387) over a lifetime horizon vs all comparators. Secukinumab dominated all treatments, except for infliximab and its biosimilar, which achieved minimally more QALYs (8.58). However, infliximab and its biosimilar incurred more costs than secukinumab (infliximab: CAD 1,015,437; infliximab biosimilar: CAD 941,004), resulting in higher cost-effectiveness estimates relative to secukinumab. In the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab dominated all treatments as it generated more QALYs (8.89) at lower costs (CAD 954,692). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated the results were most sensitive to variation in PsARC response rates, change in HAQ, and utility values in both populations.
Secukinumab is either dominant or cost-effective vs all licensed biologics for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations in Canada.

Abstract 255. Title: Cost-effectiveness analysis of secukinumab in ankylosing spondylitis from the Canadian perspective.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30346844
Abstract: To assess the cost-effectiveness of interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor secukinumab vs the currently licensed biologic therapies in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients from a Canadian healthcare system perspective.
A decision analytic model (semi-Markov) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in a biologic-naïve population, over 60 years of time horizon (lifetime). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments.
In the biologic-naïve population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit vs all comparators at various cost thresholds.
This analysis demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg is the most cost-effective treatment option for biologic-naïve AS patients compared to certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar for a lifetime horizon in Canada. Treatment with secukinumab translates into substantial benefits for patients and the healthcare system.

Abstract 256. Title: Long-term efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) after switching from originator infliximab: open-label extension of the NOR-SWITCH trial.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30762274
Abstract: The 52-week, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority, government-funded NOR-SWITCH trial demonstrated that switching from infliximab originator to less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab originator. The NOR-SWITCH extension trial aimed to assess efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients on CT-P13 throughout the 78-week study period (maintenance group) versus patients switched to CT-P13 at week 52 (switch group). The primary outcome was disease worsening during follow-up based on disease-specific composite measures.
Patients were recruited from 24 Norwegian hospitals, 380 of 438 patients who completed the main study: 197 in the maintenance group and 183 in the switch group. In the full analysis set, 127 (33%) had Crohn's disease, 80 (21%) ulcerative colitis, 67 (18%) spondyloarthritis, 55 (15%) rheumatoid arthritis, 20 (5%) psoriatic arthritis and 31 (8%) chronic plaque psoriasis.
Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups at the time of switching (week 52). Disease worsening occurred in 32 (16.8%) patients in the maintenance group vs. 20 (11.6%) in the switch group (per-protocol set). Adjusted risk difference was 5.9% (95% CI -1.1 to 12.9). Frequency of adverse events, anti-drug antibodies, changes in generic disease variables and disease-specific composite measures were comparable between arms. The study was inadequately powered to detect noninferiority within individual diseases.
The NOR-SWITCH extension showed no difference in safety and efficacy between patients who maintained CT-P13 and patients who switched from originator infliximab to CT-P13, supporting that switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 is safe and efficacious.

Abstract 257. Title: Efficacy of three filgrastim-intended copies for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in healthy adult and pediatric donors in Mexico.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30946494
Abstract: The use of filgrastim biosimilars for healthy adult and pediatric donor mobilization in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been met with increased safety and efficacy concerns in contrast to generic small molecule drugs. In Mexico, several filgrastim-intended copies (FIC) have been available and marketed since 2001, while no clinical comparability studies to evaluate their use in this setting have been published and thus are not considered to be true biosimilars. In this study, we report our experience using three different FIC products currently available (Filatil, Dextrifyl, and Biofilgran).
We retrospectively evaluated 118 related donors of all ages who received any brand 5 μg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days and were harvested in a single apheresis system on day 5.
Donors had a median age of 38 years (range, 1-69). A successful harvest defined as ≥2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight was achieved in 95.8% of cases, with a median CD34+ cell dose of 9.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> /kg (range 1-42.8). A single apheresis session was performed in 89.8% of cases. No significant difference in cell yield between each brand was observed. All pediatric donors had a successful harvest with similar results to adult donors. No immediate severe adverse effects were documented in any case.
In conclusion, three FICs available in Mexico were efficacious and without immediate severe adverse effects, resulting in significant cost savings. Evaluation of immunogenicity and establishment of a pharmacovigilance program with the use of FICs is warranted.

Abstract 258. Title: Biosimilars: are they bioequivalent?
Publication Date: 2014-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25531357
Abstract: Biologics have revolutionized several areas of medical therapeutics, and dozens of them are used by millions of patients. Monoclonal antibodies are only one type of biologics, but more than 900 are now in different phases of development. These drugs are complex to make and not cheap. The market is constantly increasing, and several biosimilars (copies of biologics) are being used, while many are still waiting to become available to the public. Biosimilars are more complex than generics, and regulatory agencies have very stringent criteria for approval. In the IBD field, the biosimilar infliximab (Inflectra®, Remsima®) has been recently approved by the EMA, but not by Canadian authorities. The EMA has considered that 'high similarity' in preclinical studies together with clinical data from two trials in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis warrant the 'extrapolation' for all approved indications for original infliximab (Remicade®), specifically Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Canadian authorities have not accepted extrapolation, based on differences in glycosylation (fucosylation) that could be related to properties important in Crohn's disease. Most scientific societies do support the idea of asking for specific clinical trials before approval, although they acknowledge that following EMA, FDA, and WHO guidelines warrant safe products. Practical issues such as interchangeability and substitution remain unsolved, and it is very likely that there will be different solutions at the national level. Pharmacovigilance plans will be key for obtaining reliable data. Biosimilars are not better drugs, but can be clearly cheaper and may facilitate access to new treatments in many populations.

Abstract 259. Title: Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease: ready for prime time?
Publication Date: 2015-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039720
Abstract: The goal is to review the most recent literature about biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with emphasis on controversial regulatory issues.
Although biosimilars have been in use in Europe since 2005, the recent approval of CT-P13 (Remsima, Inflectra), a biosimilar of the reference infliximab (Remicade), by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and several regulatory agencies has become a widely discussed topic in IBD, rheumatology, and other areas. Biologics are the main drivers of cost in current IBD units, and biosimilars can reduce prices thus increasing the availability of this type of treatment. The guidelines for evaluation of biosimilars are considerably different from those of the reference biologics, regulatory agencies relying on detailed in-vitro studies for defining 'high similarity', and requiring many fewer clinical data. 'High similarity' is considered sufficient for clinical trials, as the new molecule is demonstrated so structurally similar to the reference one that no significant difference in efficacy or safety is expected. Two trials in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis gave no evidence of real difference and provided the required pharmacokinetic and PD data. The main controversy remains in the 'extrapolation' of indications, accepted by EMA but not by Health Canada. Position statements from several scientific societies and some expert's reviews have expressed concerns to the concept of extrapolation without direct IBD clinical evidence, whereas EMA experts have published detailed reviews supporting extrapolation.
Biosimilars in IBD are here to stay. New data are awaited to settle the controversy of extrapolation, but only the complex behavior of markets will show whether biosimilars fuel competition and extend access to biologics with significant cuts in drug costs.

Abstract 260. Title: Position Paper from the Portuguese Association of Hospital Pharmacists for biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.
Publication Date: 2017-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27859438
Abstract: Biopharmaceuticals are an important class of drugs for the treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory and oncologic diseases. With patent expiries, biotechnological manufacturers can now develop biosimilar drugs. Due to timeliness of introducing new and more complex biosimilars, the Portuguese Association of Hospital Pharmacists gathered to develop a common positioning on the use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.
The European pathway to biosimilar approval was developed to improve affordability and access to biological therapies, but it remains a work in progress because unresolved issues remain. Due to the present reality of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, hospital pharmacists must play an important role in ensuring the safe, effective and cost-effective use of biosimilars in health systems; and educating healthcare administrators, providers, legislators, policymakers, payors and patients about these products.
The conclusions presented in this work focused on the proposal for optimal biosimilar prescription criteria, the preparation of original biologics and biosimilars in the pharmacy, the management and selection of suppliers, extrapolation issues, the specific role of pharmacovigilance and risk management for the optimal use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.

Abstract 261. Title: Antigenic response to CT-P13 and infliximab originator in inflammatory bowel disease patients shows similar epitope recognition.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29873091
Abstract: To test the cross-immunogenicity of anti-CT-P13 IBD patients' sera to CT-P13/infliximab originator and the comparative antigenicity evoked by CT-P13/infliximab originator sera.
Sera of patients with IBD with measurable anti-CT-P13 antibodies were tested for their cross-reactivity to 5 batches of infliximab originator and CT-P13. Anti-drug antibody positive sera from treated patients were used to compare antigenic epitopes.
All 42 anti-CT-P13 and 37 anti-infliximab originator IBD sera were cross-reactive with infliximab originator and CT-P13 respectively. Concentration of anti-drug antibodies against infliximab originator or CT-P13 were strongly correlated both for IgG1 and IgG4 (P < 0.001). Anti-CT-P13 sera of patients with IBD (n = 32) exerted similar functional inhibition on CT-P13 or infliximab originator TNF binding capacity and showed reduced binding to CT-P13 in the presence of five different batches of CT-P13 and infliximab originator. Anti-CT-P13 and anti-infliximab originator IBD sera selectively enriched phage-peptides from the VH (CDR1 and CDR3) and VL domains (CDR2 and CDR3) of infliximab. Sera reactivity detected major infliximab epitopes in these regions of infliximab in 60%-79% of patients, and no significant differences were identified between CT-P13 and infliximab originator immunogenic sera. Minor epitopes were localised in framework regions of infliximab with reduced antibody reactivity shown, in 30%-50% of patients. Monoclonal antibodies derived from naïve individuals and ADA-positive IBD patients treated with CT-P13 provided comparable epitope specificity to five different batches of CT-P13 and infliximab originator.
These results strongly support a similar antigenic profile for infliximab originator and CT-P13, and point toward a safe switching between the two drugs in anti-drug antibody negative patients.

Abstract 262. Title: Biosimilars in IBD: Will it Benefit to Patients, Physicians or the Health Care System?
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30864504
Abstract: The introduction of biological drugs has revolutionized the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), however, the increasing financial burden of biologicals on the health care system is alarming. Biosimilars are considered to be equivalent to the reference medicinal product (RMP) in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, clinical effectiveness and safety. CT-P13 infliximab was the first biosimilar to be approved by the regulatory authorities EMA and US FDA, and others are becoming increasingly available as patents expire on the RMP. Emerging data suggests that one-way switching from the RMP to an approved biosimilar is safe and acceptable, however data on multiple-switching, reversed switching, or cross-switching between biosimilars is scarce. Accumulating data on biosimilars led to an increased acceptance amongst physicians and their use can be expected to offer increased availability for patients, and also better control of economic sustainability. This review discusses the available data on clinical efficacy and safety of approved biosimilar agents, and assesses the current impact and future perspectives of biosimilars on the health care system.

Abstract 263. Title: A dissimilar biosimilar? Lichenoid drug eruption induced by an infliximab biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2018-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556906
Abstract: The advent of therapeutic antibodies, or biological medications, has transformed the treatment of many inflammatory diseases in dermatology. Recently, the development of biosimilars, biological drugs that are highly similar in quality, safety and efficacy to approved biologics, has changed this landscape. Although biosimilars are not identical to their reference product, they are required to have the same mechanism of action, route of administration, dosage form and strength as the reference product. This also leads to the possibility that subtle differences in the activity of these biosimilars can lead to differing clinical responses. We report the first case of a lichenoid eruption induced by a biosimilar to infliximab after switching from infliximab. Several days after initial infusion of the biosimilar, the patient developed a pruritic papulosquamous eruption that was biopsied to reveal a lichenoid drug eruption. Possible mechanisms for lichenoid drug eruptions as a result of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor administration are discussed, along with reasons why such a reaction may occur with a biosimilar but not the original, reference product. This case report calls attention to the unique differences between biosimilars and biological medications that a clinician should consider prior to prescribing these medications.

Abstract 264. Title: Regulatory and cost barriers are likely to limit biosimilar development and expected savings in the near future.
Publication Date: 2014-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24889955
Abstract: In March 2010 Congress established an abbreviated Food and Drug Administration approval pathway for biosimilars-drugs that are very similar but not identical to a reference biological product and cost less. Because bringing biosimilars to the market currently requires large investments of money, fewer biosimilars are expected to enter the biologics market than has been the case with generic drugs entering the small-molecule drug market. Additionally, given the high regulatory hurdles to obtaining interchangeability-which would allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar for its reference product, subject to evolving state substitution laws-most biosimilars will likely compete as therapeutic alternatives instead of as therapeutic equivalents. In other words, biosimilars will need to compete with their reference product on the basis of quality; price; and manufacturer's reputation with physicians, insurers, and patient groups. Biosimilars also will face dynamic competition from new biologics in the same therapeutic class-including "biobetters," which offer incremental improvements on reference products, such as extended duration of action. The prospects for significant cost savings from the use of biosimilars appear to be limited for the next several years, but their use should increase over time because of both demand- and supply-side factors.

Abstract 265. Title: Biosimilar rhG-CSFs: how similar are they?
Publication Date: 2012-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22318351
Abstract: Biosimilars are more affordable copycat versions of originator biological products in much the same way as generics are copies of small molecule pharmaceuticals. However, while generics are approved on the basis of structural and pharmacokinetic equivalence, the intricate structure of biological medicinal products and the complex nature of their manufacturing process in living organisms impose a separate, and more stringent, regulatory approval process. The aims of this article are (a) to discuss key aspects of the development process and authorization requirements for biosimilars in Europe using published comparative physicochemical and clinical data for EU-approved recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) biosimilars, the most recent addition to the therapeutic category of hematopoietic growth factors, and (b) to demonstrate that the rigorous scientific evaluation process is designed to ensure that their clinical safety and efficacy is not compromised by the abbreviated development program.

Abstract 266. Title: Strategies for Overcoming Barriers to Adopting Biosimilars and Achieving Goals of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act: A Survey of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy Professionals.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31007119
Abstract: The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, which included pathways for FDA approval of biosimilar products, was designed to promote more affordable, expanded patient access to biologic therapies. Achieving these BPCIA goals depends on overcoming formidable barriers to biosimilar adoption. Managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals are uniquely qualified to inform initiatives to address these barriers.
To assess perceptions regarding strategies for overcoming barriers to biosimilar adoption among managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals by conducting a survey study.
Invitations to complete the online survey were emailed by the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) to members and customers and to contacts sourced from a commercial database. In addition to questions on respondent demographics and perceptions of biosimilars, the survey listed 16 strategies for overcoming key barriers to biosimilar adoption. On a 5-point scale, participants rated their opinion on the likelihood that each strategy would have the potential to assist in achieving BPCIA goals. The survey also listed 6 barriers to biosimilar adoption. On a 5-point scale, participants rated their perceived difficulty in overcoming each barrier. The survey concluded with an open-text item that asked participants to list 3 additional strategies for overcoming biosimilar adoption barriers. Response frequencies were calculated to describe participants' ratings of the strategies and barriers. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess whether the ratings differed among respondents grouped by work organization. For the open-text item, we conducted qualitative content analyses to categorize strategies by stakeholder groups that might take primary implementation roles.
A total of 300 managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals completed the survey. There was considerable variation in the preferences, policies, and practices regarding biosimilar adoption among respondents' work organizations. Responses to several survey items reflected positive attitudes about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars; for example, 84% agreed or strongly agreed that FDA-approved biosimilars are safe and effective for patients who switch from a reference biologic. Based on pooled percentages for ratings of likely and extremely likely to overcome barriers to biosimilar adoption, the highest-rated strategies were for prescriber education about evidence from switching studies (91%) and FDA guidance on pharmacy-level substitution of reference biologics with biosimilars (90%). The lowest-rated strategies were for requiring therapeutic drug monitoring for patients who switch to biosimilars (39%) and using quotas to incentivize providers to prescribe biosimilars (40%). For the qualitative analysis, the highest numbers of respondents' suggested strategies indicated primary implementation roles of biosimilar manufacturers (40%), the federal government (26%), and managed care organizations (15%).
Reflecting the unique knowledge, perspectives, and practices of managed care and specialty pharmacy professionals, the study findings are relevant to informing and advancing initiatives for achieving BPCIA goals.

Abstract 267. Title: The EGALITY study: a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of GP2015, a proposed etanercept biosimilar, vs. the originator product in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2017-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27787890
Abstract: GP2015 is a proposed etanercept biosimilar.
To demonstrate equivalent efficacy, and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and the etanercept originator (ETN, Enbrel<sup>®</sup> ) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
In total, 531 eligible patients were randomized 1 : 1 to self-administer GP2015 or ETN twice weekly subcutaneously. Patients with ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were rerandomized to continue the same treatment on a once-weekly dosing schedule or to undergo a sequence of three treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Thereafter, patients continued treatment with the product they had been assigned to last, up to week 52.
The difference in PASI 75 (75% improvement from baseline PASI score) response rates at week 12 between GP2015 and ETN (primary end point) was -2·3%. The 95% confidence interval (-9·85 to 5·30) was well contained within the prespecified margin range of -18 to 18. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 52 was comparable between continued GP2015 (59·8%) and ETN (57·3%); switching treatments revealed comparable safety profiles. Antidrug antibodies, all non-neutralizing, were limited to five patients on ETN during treatment period 1, and one patient in the switched ETN group, who had been treated with GP2015 for 12 weeks at the time of the finding.
The EGALITY study demonstrated equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and ETN. The study results provide the final clinical confirmation of biosimilarity and contribute to the totality of the evidence proposing that GP2015 is an etanercept biosimilar.

Abstract 268. Title: Loss of efficacy and safety of the switch from infliximab original to infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-14
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30581277
Abstract: Infliximab original has changed the natural history of inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over the past two decades. However, the recent expiration of its patent has allowed the entry of the first Infliximab biosimilar into the European and Spanish markets. Currently switching drugs data in IBD are limited.
To compare the efficacy of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, against infliximab original, analyzing the loss of response of both at the 12 mo follow-up in patients with IBD.
An observational study of two cohorts has been conducted. One retrospective cohort that included patients with IBD treated with Infliximab original, and a prospective cohort of patients who were switching from infliximab original to infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13). We had analyzed the overall efficacy and loss of efficacy in patients in remission at the end of one year after treatment with the original drug compared to the results of the year of treatment with the biosimilar.
98 patients (CD 67, CU 31) were included in both cohorts. The overall efficacy for infliximab original per year of treatment was 71% <i>vs</i> 68.2% for infliximab biosimilar (<i>P</i> = 0.80). The loss of overall efficacy at 12 mo for infliximab original was 6.6% <i>vs</i> 14.5% for infliximab biosimilar (<i>P</i> = 0.806). The loss of efficacy in patients who were in basal remission was 16.3% for infliximab original <i>vs</i> 27.1% for infliximab biosimilar. Adverse events were 9.2% for infliximab original <i>vs</i> 11.2% for infliximab biosimilar.
The overall efficacy and loss of treatment response with infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) is similar to that observed with infliximab original in patients who were switching at the 12 mo follow-up. There is no difference in the rate of adverse events.

Abstract 269. Title: Long-term follow up after switching from original infliximab to an infliximab biosimilar: real-world data.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31258621
Abstract: Several studies have reported positive efficacy outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with CT-P13, an infliximab biosimilar. Data from follow-up periods longer than 1 year are still scarce. Here, we assessed the long-term efficacy data, loss of response and safety after switching from infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
This was a prospective single-center observational study involving patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis switched from infliximab to CT-P13 treatment and reviewed up to 24 months. Efficacy and loss of response were measured using the Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) index and partial Mayo score for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. C-reactive protein, infliximab drug levels, adverse events and antidrug antibodies were also monitored throughout the study.
A total of 64 patients with Crohn's disease and 36 patients with ulcerative colitis were included. Most of them (72%) remained on CT-P13. Overall, 28% of patients discontinued the therapy due to loss of response, adverse events or long-lasting clinical remission. Remission at 18 and 24 months occurred in 69.9% and 68.5% of patients, respectively. Dose increase was performed in 22% of patients, with remission being reached in 60% of them. HB index, partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein and infliximab drug levels did not show significant changes. Serious adverse events were reported in 14% of patients. Overall, two patients developed low levels of antidrug antibodies.
Most of the patients switching from original infliximab were maintained on CT-P13 at 2 years of follow up with a good profile of efficacy and safety.

Abstract 270. Title: Switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: results of a multicenter study after 12 months.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893581
Abstract: infliximab has changed the natural history of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). The advent of biosimilar treatments such as CT-P13 will hopefully improve the availability of biological therapies. Data with regard to drug switching are currently limited. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of switching from the reference product (RP), infliximab, to CT-P13 in patients with IBD.
this was a multicenter prospective observational study in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). All patients had switched from infliximab RP (Remicade®) to CT-P13 treatment and were followed up for 12 months. The efficacy endpoint was the change in clinical remission assessed at 0 and 12 months, according to the Harvey-Bradshaw score and partial Mayo score for patients with CD and UC, respectively. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the study.
a total of 167 patients (116 CD/51 UC) were included; 88.8% (103/116) of patients with CD were in remission at the time of the drug switch and 69.7% were in remission at 12 months. The Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) score significantly changed at 12 months (p = 0.001); 84.3% (43/51) of patients with UC were in remission at the time of the drug switch and 76.7% were in remission at 12 months. No significant changes in the median partial Mayo score (p = 0.87) were observed at 12 months. Serious adverse events related to medication were reported in 12/167 (7.2%) cases.
switching from infliximab RP to CT-P13 is safe and effective at 12 months. The loss of efficacy at 12 months was 15.7%.

Abstract 271. Title: Evolution after switching to biosimilar infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease patients in clinical remission.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28865888
Abstract: The biosimilar of infliximab (CT-P13) has been approved for the same indications held by the infliximab reference product (Remicade<sup>®</sup>); however, there are few clinical data on switching in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, bioavailability profile and factors associated with relapse after switching to biosimilar infliximab in IBD patients in clinical remission.
Observational study with IBD patients treated with Remicade<sup>®</sup> for at least 6 months and in clinical remission for at least 3 months who switched to infliximab biosimilar. The incidence of relapse, adverse effects and possible changes in drug bioavailability (trough level and antidrug antibodies) were evaluated.
Thirty six patients were included (63.9% CD) with a mean follow-up of 8.4 months (SD±3.5). The 13.9% had clinical relapse. The longer clinical remission time before switching (HR=0.54, 95% CI=0.29-0.98, P=.04) and detectable infliximab levels at the time of switching (HR=0.03, 95% CI=0.001-0.89, P=.04) were associated with a lower risk of relapse. No differences were found between infliximab levels at the time of switching and at weeks 8 and 16 (P=.94); 8.3% of the patients had some adverse event, requiring the suspension of biosimilar in one patient for severe pneumonia.
Switching to biosimilar infliximab in a real-life cohort of IBD patients in clinical remission did not have a significant impact on short-term clinical outcomes. The factors associated with relapse were similar to those expected in patients continuing with Remicade<sup>®</sup>.

Abstract 272. Title: Switching from infliximab originator to a first biosimilar is safe and effective. Results of a case-control study with drug levels and antibodies evaluation.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31272935
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease is treated with anti-TNF agents such as infliximab and its biosimilars, but use of biosimilars is limited due to perceived risks of adverse events.
To explore safety and effectiveness of switching from the infliximab originator to a first biosimilar.
Clinical and biological outcomes were compared between 53 patients who switched from the infliximab originator to the biosimilar CT-P13 (Switched group) and 13 patients treated with CT-P13 from the beginning (Naïve group). Infliximab trough levels and antidrug antibodies were measured.
At enrolment, patients in the Switched group had a longer median duration of infliximab treatment than Naïve (4.0 vs. 0.6 years, p < 0.0001) but similar proportions of patients were in remission (77% and 62%, respectively). Infliximab discontinuation due to adverse events or loss of efficacy was less common in the Switched (26%) than Naïve group (62%, p = 0.017). Variables independently associated with time to discontinuation were disease activity (p < 0.0001) and immunomodulating treatment (p = 0.019) at enrolment. Trough levels and antidrug antibodies were similar between groups during observation.
This study confirms that switching from infliximab originator to a first biosimilar is safe and effective. Patients at highest risk of losing treatment efficacy are those with active disease, irrespective of the therapeutic switch.

Abstract 273. Title: Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes previously treated with insulin glargine.
Publication Date: 2016-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26749289
Abstract: The safety and efficacy of LY2963016 insulin glargine (LY IGlar) and Lantus insulin glargine (IGlar), products with identical primary amino acid sequences, were assessed in subgroups of patients with type 1 (T1D, n = 452) or type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 299) reporting prestudy IGlar treatment in 52-week open-label (ELEMENT-1) and 24-week double-blind (ELEMENT-2) studies. At randomization, patients transitioned from their prestudy IGlar to equivalent doses of LY IGlar or IGlar. Primary efficacy (change in glycated haemoglobin from baseline to 24 weeks), other efficacy and select safety outcomes of LY IGlar were compared with those of IGlar. Continuous data were analysed using analysis of covariance, categorical data by Fisher's exact test, and treatment comparisons for hypoglycaemia by Wilcoxon test. No statistically significant treatment differences were identified for efficacy and safety outcomes except for weight change (T1D), overall incidence of detectable insulin antibodies (T2D), and serious adverse events (T2D). These differences were neither consistently observed across both studies nor observed in the total study populations, and their magnitude suggests they were not clinically meaningful. LY IGlar and IGlar show similar efficacy and safety profiles in patients reporting prestudy IGlar treatment.

Abstract 274. Title: Impact of a medical interview on the decision to switch from originator infliximab to its biosimilar in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31648920
Abstract: To lighten the burden on health-care spending, switching from the infliximab originator to a biosimilar in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is advocated. However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.
To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.
After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.
93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.
This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.

Abstract 275. Title: Switching Australian patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease from originator to biosimilar infliximab: a multicentre, parallel cohort study.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070332
Abstract: To examine whether non-medical switching of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from originator infliximab to a biosimilar (CT-P13, Inflectra) is safe and clinically non-inferior to continued treatment with originator infliximab.
Prospective, open label, multicentre, parallel cohort, non-inferiority study in seven Australian hospitals over 48 weeks, May 2017 - October 2019.
Adults (18 years or older) with IBD receiving maintenance originator infliximab (Remicade) who had been in steroid-free clinical remission for at least 12 weeks.
Managed program for switching patients in four hospitals from originator to biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13); patients in three other hospitals continued to receive originator infliximab (control).
Clinical disease worsening requiring infliximab dose escalation or change in therapy.
The switch group included 204 patients, the control group 141 patients with IBD. Ten patients in the control group (7%) and 16 patients switched to CT-P13 (8%) experienced clinical deterioration; the adjusted risk difference (control v switch group) was -1.1 percentage points (95% CI, -6.1 to 8.2 percentage points), within our pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 15 percentage points. Serious adverse events leading to infliximab discontinuation were infrequent in both the switch (six, 3%) and control (six, 4%) groups.
Switching patients with IBD from originator to biosimilar infliximab is safe and non-inferior to continuing treatment with originator infliximab. Moreover, the introduction of biosimilar infliximab, by increasing market competition, has resulted in substantial cost savings for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

Abstract 277. Title: Clinical and Regulatory Concerns of Biosimilars: A Review of Literature.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-11
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32796549
Abstract: Although biosimilars have been part of clinical practice for more than a decade, healthcare professionals (HCPs) do not fully accept them. This is because of the perception that biosimilars may not be like their originators in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. This study aims to evaluate the current knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals toward biosimilar prescription, and to elaborate on their concerns. We reviewed the literature using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct electronic databases in the period from 2018 to 2020. The knowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals vary between countries, between clinical profiles and between studies. Although most of the healthcare professionals had a positive attitude to prescribing biosimilars, they would still prefer to prescribe them in initial treatment. Generally, HCPs were against multiple switches and substitution of biosimilars at the pharmacy level. HCP's key concern was interchangeability, with eventual consequences on the clinical outcome of patients. HCPs still approach biosimilars with caution and stigma. HCPs need to have an unbiased coherent understanding of biosimilars at clinical, molecular and regulatory levels. It was also observed that most of their concerns are more theoretical than science-based. Physicians are in an excellent position to accept biosimilars, but they need the additional support of regulatory authorities to approve and take into consideration the available scientific data regarding biosimilars.

Abstract 278. Title: Influence of biosimilar infliximab launch on the utilization pattern of biological medicines: the case of Hungary.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31510811
Abstract: <b>Objectives</b>: Utilization of multisource biological (off-patent originator and its biosimilar) medicines can improve the efficiency of resource allocation by 1) generating savings while maintaining health outcomes or 2) increasing the number of patients treated with more affordable treatments. This study evaluates the efficiency of the Hungarian biosimilar drug policy on the case of biosimilar infliximab. <b>Methods</b>: We analyzed the utilization of biologicals in all reimbursed indications of infliximab including initial therapy of new patients and switching patterns retrospectively based on patient-level payer's data between September 2012 and December 2016. <b>Results</b>: Despite the economic rationale, patent expiry did not manifest in increased utilization of multisource infliximab in an access-restricted environment: 1) Patients previously treated with original biologicals were switched mainly to other original biologicals instead of more affordable biosimilar alternatives. 2) Although some treatment-naive patients started on more affordable multisource infliximab with price competition, the majority of new patients started on other original biologicals with monopolistic price. <b>Conclusion</b>: Policy tools and measures should be developed to facilitate first-line use of multisource biologicals for treatment-naive patients and promoting the use of more affordable multisource biologicals in case of switching.

Abstract 279. Title: Therapeutic efficacy of a biosimilar epoetin alfa in hemodialysis patients.
Publication Date: 2015-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25579720
Abstract: Anemia is a frequent complication in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, human recombinant erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) has revolutionized the management of anemia in chronically dialyzed patients. Epomax ® is a new rHu-EPO alfa manufactured in Tunisia (Medis Laboratories). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of Epomax ® in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients in a phase-III, multicenter, clinical trial. Fiftythree HD patients (mean age 47.7 ± 13 years) who received a stable dose of rHu-EPO (Hemax ® , a rHu-EPO alfa manufactured by Biosidus Laboratories) subcutaneously were switched to Epomax ® via the same route of administration. At baseline, the mean systolic pressure was 132 ± 18 mm Hg and the mean diastolic pressure was 79 ± 8 mm Hg. The mean blood hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL and the median ferritin level was 667 ng/mL. After a follow-up of 43 days, the mean blood hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL under the effect of Epomax ® . There was no significant difference in the mean hemoglobin levels between the treatments with both drugs. Few adverse events were reported during the study. We conclude that Epomax ® was effective at maintaining the hemoglobin levels at target concentrations and was well tolerated in HD patients.

Abstract 280. Title: Rapid and Sustained Improvement in a Patient With Plaque Psoriasis Switched to Brodalumab After Failing Treatment Clearance on Six Other Biologic Therapies.
Publication Date: 2020-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023014
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, remitting/relapsing autoimmune condition involving a dysregulated inflammatory response of the interleukin (IL) 23/T-helper (Th)-17 pathway. Greater understanding of the immune-mediated pathology of the disease has led to the development of numerous biological therapies and biosimilars that target the various inflammatory pathways. Each biologic has a unique mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics resulting in different clinical efficacy and tolerability. This case describes a 64-year-old female with a nine-year history of plaque psoriasis, predominantly affecting her feet, who was successfully treated with brodalumab having previously failed multiple topical and systemic therapies including six other biologicals. To date, there are few guidelines to help physicians select the optimal biology agent and none that have looked specifically at plantar psoriasis. For this patient, finding a biologic that worked and was tolerable was a process of trial and error that took four years. The results achieved in this previously refractory patient with difficult-to-treat psoriasis may be due to the unique mechanism of action of brodalumab, though this will need to be confirmed in larger studies.

Abstract 281. Title: Mapping from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th to 10th Revision for Research in Biologics and Biosimilars Using Administrative Healthcare Data.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31854053
Abstract: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes on October 1, 2015. Postmarketing surveillance of newly marketed drugs, including novel biologics and biosimilars, requires a robust approach to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes for study variables. We examined three mapping methods for health conditions (HCs) of interest to the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and compared their prevalence.
Using CMS General Equivalence Mappings, we applied forward-backward mapping (FBM) to 108 HCs and secondary mapping (SM) and tertiary mapping (TM) to seven preselected HCs. A physician reviewed the mapped ICD-10 codes. The prevalence of the 108 HCs defined by ICD-9 versus ICD-10 codes was examined in BBCIC's distributed research network (September 1, 2012 to March 31, 2018). We visually assessed prevalence trends of these HCs and applied a threshold of 20% level change in ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence.
Nearly four times more ICD-10 codes were mapped by SM and TM than FBM, but most were irrelevant or nonspecific. For conditions like myocardial infarction, SM or TM did not generate additional ICD-10 codes. Through visual inspection, one-fifth of the HCs had inconsistent ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence trends. 13% of HCs had a level change greater than +/-20%.
FBM is generally the most efficient way to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes, yet manual review of converted ICD-10 codes is recommended even for FBM. The lack of existing guidance to compare the performance of ICD-9 with ICD-10 codes led to challenges in empirically determining the quality of conversions.

Abstract 282. Title: Biosimilar insulins: guidance for data interpretation by clinicians and users.
Publication Date: 2015-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974131
Abstract: Biosimilar insulins are approved copies of insulins outside patent protection. Advantages may include greater market competition and potential cost reduction, but clinicians and users lack a clear perspective on 'biosimilarity' for insulins. The manufacturing processes for biosimilar insulins are manufacturer-specific and, although these are reviewed by regulators there are few public data available to allow independent assessment or review of issues such as intrinsic quality or batch-to-batch variation. Preclinical measures used to assess biosimilarity, such as tissue and cellular studies of metabolic activity, physico-chemical stability and animal studies of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity may be insufficiently sensitive to differences, and are often not formally published. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (glucose clamps) with humans, although core assessments, have problems of precision which are relevant for accurate insulin dosing. Studies that assess clinical efficacy and safety and device compatibility are limited by current outcome measures, such as glycated haemoblobin levels and hypoglycaemia, which are insensitive to differences between insulins. To address these issues, we suggest that all comparative data are put in the public domain, and that systematic clinical studies are performed to address batch-to-batch variability, delivery devices, interchangeability in practice and long-term efficacy and safety. Despite these challenges biosimilar insulins are a welcome addition to diabetes therapy and, with a transparent approach, should provide useful benefit to insulin users.

Abstract 283. Title: Medical specialists' attitudes to prescribing biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2017-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28233367
Abstract: Biosimilars are a cost-effective alternative to biologics that could improve patients' access to expensive biological medicines. Currently, there are little data on doctors' perceptions of biosimilars and in what situations they are comfortable prescribing biosimilars. In this study, we investigated medical specialists' perceptions of biosimilars and the factors associated with the acceptance of biosimilars.
A national sample of 110 of 327 medical specialists working in the areas of rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology, oncology and haematology completed an online questionnaire examining attitudes towards prescribing biosimilars, indication extrapolation and switching patients to a biosimilar.
Most specialists held positive views of biosimilars, with between 54 and 74% confident in the safety, efficacy, manufacturing and pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Seventy-one percent of specialists agreed that they would prescribe biosimilars for all or some conditions meeting relevant clinical criteria. Specialists were less confident about indication extrapolation and switching patients from an existing biologic. Acceptance of biosimilars was significantly associated with a lower perceived time to explain a biosimilar to a patient and lower number of weekly patient appointments. The most common situations that they would not prescribe a biosimilar was where there was a lack of clinical data supporting efficacy (32%), or evidence of adverse effects (17%).
Medical specialists held generally positive attitudes towards biosimilars but were less confident in indication extrapolation and switching patients from a biologic. Providing clinicians with guidance on how to explain biosimilars to patients and written patient material may help overcome some of the barriers to the use of biosimilars.

Abstract 284. Title: GP2017: An Adalimumab Biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30460599
Abstract: GP2017 (adalimumab) is a biosimilar anti-TNF-α antibody. It is approved in the EU for use in all indications for which reference adalimumab is approved. GP2017 has similar physicochemical and functional properties to those of reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of the agent has been shown in healthy male volunteers. GP2017 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis; the tolerability, safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two agents were also similar. Multiple switching between GP2017 and reference adalimumab (up to four times) had no impact on efficacy, tolerability or immunogenicity. The role of reference adalimumab in the management of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is well established and GP2017 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring adalimumab therapy.

Abstract 285. Title: AURIEL-PsO: a randomized, double-blind phase III equivalence trial to demonstrate the clinical similarity of the proposed biosimilar MSB11022 to reference adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31206593
Abstract: MSB11022 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar.
To compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11022 with reference adalimumab.
AURIEL-PsO was a double-blind randomized controlled equivalence trial, in which patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis were randomized 1 : 1 to MSB11022 or reference adalimumab. The primary end point was ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16, with a prespecified equivalence interval of ± 18%. Patients with a ≥50% improvement in PASI at week 16 were eligible to enter a double-blind extension period: patients receiving MSB11022 continued treatment, and patients receiving reference adalimumab were rerandomized 1 : 1 either to continue reference adalimumab or to switch to MSB11022. Other efficacy end points and safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated at scheduled visits up to weeks 52 (efficacy and immunogenicity), 54 and 66 (safety).
In total, 443 patients were randomized. The difference in PASI 75 response rates at week 16 between the treatment arms was -1·9%, and the 95% confidence interval (-7·8% to 4·1%) was within the prespecified equivalence interval. No notable difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was observed between treatment arms up to the end of the trial, and no new safety signals were observed. Following treatment switch at week 16, no clinically meaningful differences in safety or immunogenicity were seen between treatment arms through to the end of the observation period.
Therapeutic equivalence between MSB11022 and reference adalimumab was demonstrated. AURIEL-PsO provides evidence to support the similarity of both products with regard to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. What's already known about this topic? Adalimumab is a fully human antitumour necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody, indicated for the treatment of multiple inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and ankylosing spondylitis. MSB11022 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar that has shown structural and functional similarity to the reference product in an extensive analytical comparability exercise. MSB11022 has demonstrated bioequivalence and comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles in a phase I study in healthy volunteers. What does this study add? This phase III study confirmed equivalent efficacy for MSB11022 and reference adalimumab in patients without any immunomodulation comedication in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis at week 16. The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of MSB11022 and reference adalimumab were similar over the respective observation periods (week 52 for efficacy and immunogenicity, week 66 for safety). A switch from reference adalimumab to MSB11022 at week 16 did not impact efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.

Abstract 286. Title: Trastuzumab Biosimilars in the Therapy of Breast Cancer - "Real World" Experiences from four Bavarian University Breast Centres.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905322
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b> With the introduction of the first trastuzumab biosimilar in the summer of 2018, biosimilar antibodies for breast cancer have found their way into the area of gynaecological oncology. The switch of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy from the reference drug Herceptin <sup>®</sup> to a biosimilar has presented challenges to the clinics. In addition to structural and organisational measures, training of employees as well as patient briefing and acceptance were major challenges. The study presented here records - within the context of quality assurance - how the switch to a trastuzumab biosimilar was implemented at four Bavarian university clinics in the Purchasing Association of Bavarian University Pharmacies. <b>Materials/Methods</b> Questionnaires on treatment figures and the switching process were sent to breast centres and pharmacies of four Bavarian university clinics between July and December 2019. The neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastasised anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab was recorded, evaluated and summarised. <b>Results</b> In the anti-HER2-therapy, trastuzumab was used intravenously (i. v.) and subcutaneously. Between July and December 2018, all four clinics in the Purchasing Association switched the i. v. trastuzumab therapy from the reference drug (Herceptin) to a biosimilar (for 2018: Kanjinti <sup>®</sup> ). Over 200 patients were treated with trastuzumab i. v. in each of the two half-years of 2018 (before and after the switch). The spectrum of side effects and pCR rates under therapy with the biosimilar were comparable to the experiences made with the reference drug. Three out of four clinics provided training to employees and informed patients by means of a defined information leaflet. Patient acceptance was high. <b>Summary</b> The anti-HER2 therapy could be switched successfully and safely to trastuzumab biosimilars at the Bavarian university hospitals. This may serve as guideline for the further implementation of biosimilars. The structures necessary for this initial switching process have been prepared with trastuzumab as an example.

Abstract 287. Title: Biosimilars: a cure to the U.S. health care cost conundrum?
Publication Date: 2014-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25260225
Abstract: As the cost of healthcare continues to rise and patents on biologics near expiration, biosimilars are gaining visibility as a mechanism for cost reduction. Yet, the introduction of biosimilars into the U.S. market will be complex, due to the related complexity of production, research requirements, and regulatory uncertainty. The purpose of this paper is to frame the relevant issues in order to provide context for stakeholders. It is particularly crucial that clinicians understand the scientific, regulatory, legislative and economic considerations involved in order to ensure that the path to approval is consistent with their needs and that appropriate utilization occurs, once approved.

Abstract 288. Title: Biosimilars in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Publication Date: 2014-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24722561
Abstract: A biosimilar is a copy of an approved biological medicine whose patent protections have expired. Biosimilars of antibodies to tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) are becoming important in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The first one introduced commercially is an infliximab biosimilar. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of anti-TNFα biosimilars. The literature on biosimilars of monoclonal anti-TNFα antibodies was reviewed, including their manufacture and approval pathways, concerns about efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, extrapolation, switching and labelling. Previous experience with biosimilars of epoetin and other growth factors was also reviewed. The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody registered for the treatment of IBD. The major advantage of biosimilars is the reduced cost of therapy. Concerns have arisen, however, about the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in IBD, the extrapolation of results from rheumatologic trials to IBD and the free interchangeability of CT-P13 with infliximab. Experience with simple peptide biosimilars, such as epoetins and growth factors, has generally been positive, with these biosimilars having similar efficacy and safety as the original products, although immunogenicity remains a major concern. Upcoming postregistration studies will address concerns on biosimilars in IBD, including their efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, switching and interchangeability. Biosimilars active against the same epitopes, but with improved pharmacokinetic properties that enhance their efficacy and/or safety, may be the next stage in the development of biosimilars. Anti-TNFα biosimilars represent promising new treatment options for patients with IBD. However, data on their efficacy and safety in IBD are needed.

Abstract 289. Title: Management of rheumatoid arthritis: 2019 updated consensus recommendations from the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology.
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31485846
Abstract: The expanding range of treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), from conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), biosimilar bDMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, has improved patient outcomes but increased the complexity of treatment decisions. These updated consensus recommendations from the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology provide guidance on the management of RA, with a focus on how to integrate newly available DMARDs into clinical practice. The recommendations were developed based on evidence from the literature along with local expert opinion. Early diagnosis of RA and prompt initiation of effective therapy remain crucial and we suggest a treat-to-target approach to guide optimal sequencing of DMARDs in RA patients to achieve tight disease control. Newly available DMARDs are incorporated in the treatment algorithm, resulting in a greater range of second-line treatment options. In the event of treatment failure or intolerance, switching to another DMARD with a similar or different mode of action may be considered. Given the variety of available treatments and the heterogeneity of patients with RA, treatment decisions should be tailored to the individual patient taking into consideration prognostic factors, medical comorbidities, drug safety, cost of treatment, and patient preference.

Abstract 291. Title: Switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab - real world data of a prospective 18 months follow-up of a single-centre IBD population.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29852793
Abstract: Long-term data regarding switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 are sparse. Concerns about increased immunogenicity after switching have been raised. We aimed to study the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity after switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 in a real-world IBD population with 18 months prospective follow-up.
All adult IBD patients treated with originator infliximab at the Department of Gastroenterology, Oslo University Hospital, were switched to CT-P13 and followed prospectively for 18 months. The primary endpoints were (i) the proportion of patients remaining on CT-P13 18 months after switching and (ii) immunogenicity during 18 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included (i) adverse events, (ii) changes in disease activity, C-reactive protein, anaemia, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval and p-infliximab.
In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. Altogether, 130 (91%) remained on CT-P13 throughout 18 months. Two patients developed ADAs at moderate level and discontinued CT-P13. Another 10 patients discontinued CT-P13 (two due to loss of response without ADAs, four due to adverse events, and four in remission and a personal wish to stop). There was no overall change in disease activity scores or in the other studied variables except for p-infliximab, which increased significantly.
The present study provides valuable evidence for the safety and effectiveness of switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab over a prolonged period of 18 months and demonstrates that switching was well tolerated and did not affect the long term clinical outcome.

Abstract 292. Title: A population-based study comparing biosimilar versus originator erythropoiesis-stimulating agent consumption in 6,117 patients with renal anaemia.
Publication Date: 2013-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23052412
Abstract: There are concerns that biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are less effective than the originator ESAs. The objective of our study was to investigate differences between originator and biosimilar ESA utilisation based on defined daily doses (DDD), doses upon switching, differences between short- and long-acting ESAs and prescribed daily doses (PDD) of either ESA in ambulatory patients with renal anaemia undergoing chronic maintenance haemodialysis [chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5].
Patients with CKD stage 5 and specific pharmacotherapy with ESAs for at least six 3-month periods (accounting quarters) were selected from a population-based database of accounting information of Bavarian physicians and pharmacy claims data (January 2008 to December 2010). The DDD was used to determine mean ESA consumption. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results.
In our study, 6,177 CKD stage 5 patients received ESAs for ≥6 accounting quarters, of whom 64.4 % received originator ESAs, 21.1 % received biosimilars and 14.6 % received any sequence originator and biosimilar (total of 35.7 % any biosimilar). Patients receiving either originator short-acting ESAs, long-acting darbepoetin-alfa or M-PEG epoetin-beta had a median DDD consumption of 0.77, 0.81 and 0.90, respectively. Patients receiving a biosimilar short-acting ESA had a median DDD consumption of 0.82. Doses were not increased when the therapy was switched from the originator to the biosimilar ESA. These results were confirmed in 1,886 patients receiving a continuous prescription over 12 accounting quarters, with patients receiving short-acting originator ESAs, long-acting darbepoetin-alfa and biosimilar ESAs having a median daily DDD consumption of 0.80, 0.86 and 0.81, respectively.
We conclude that, based on a population based analysis, ESA consumption of patients on chronic haemodialysis is similar for biosimilar and originator ESAs.

Abstract 293. Title: MYL1501D Insulin Glargine: A Review in Diabetes Mellitus.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32215829
Abstract: Subcutaneous MYL1501D insulin glargine 100 U/mL (hereafter referred to as MYL1501D insulin glargine) [Semglee<sup>®</sup>] is a long-acting human insulin analogue approved as a biosimilar of insulin glargine 100 U/mL (hereafter referred to as reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL) [Lantus<sup>®</sup>] in various countries, including those of the EU for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients aged ≥ 2 years, as well as Japan for diabetes where insulin therapy is indicated. MYL1501D insulin glargine has similar physicochemical characteristics and biological properties to those of EU- and US-sourced reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL, with the bioequivalence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters between these agents shown in adults with type 1 diabetes. Once-daily MYL1501D insulin glargine demonstrated noninferior glycaemic efficacy to that of once-daily reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL in adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes, with its glycated haemoglobin-lowering benefits maintained over the longer-term (52 weeks) and unaffected by previous insulin exposure. Switching between MYL1501D insulin glargine and reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL did not appear to impact glycaemic efficacy in adults with type 1 diabetes. MYL1501D insulin glargine was well tolerated, demonstrating a safety and immunogenicity profile similar to that of reference insulin glargine 100 U/mL in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, and in those with type 1 diabetes switching between the two agents. As expected, hypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event. Thus, MYL1501D insulin glargine provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring insulin glargine therapy.

Abstract 294. Title: Switching from biosimilar (Basalin) to originator (Lantus) insulin glargine is effective in Chinese patients with diabetes mellitus: a retrospective chart review.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29862021
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of switching from Basalin® to Lantus® in Chinese patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). <b>Methods:</b>  A retrospective chart review conducted using the electronic medical records of patients hospitalized at the Qingdao Endocrine and Diabetes Hospital from 2005 to 2016. All patients were diagnosed with DM and underwent switching of insulin from Basalin to Lantus during hospitalization. Data collected included fasting (FBG), pre- and post-prandial whole blood glucose, insulin dose, reasons for insulin switching and hypoglycemia. Four study time points were defined as: hospital admission, Basalin initiation, insulin switching (date of final dose of Basalin), and hospital discharge. Blood glucose measurements were imputed as the values recorded closest to the dates of these four time points for each patient. <b>Results:</b> Data from 73 patients (70 patients with type 2 diabetes, 2 with type 1, and 1 undisclosed) were analyzed. At admission, mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and FBG were 8.9% (SD=1.75) and 9.98 (3.22) mmol/L, respectively. Between Basalin initiation and insulin switch, mean FBG decreased from 9.68 mmol/L to 8.03 mmol/L (p<0.0001), over a mean 10.8 (SD=6.85) days of Basalin treatment, and reduced further to 7.30 mmol/L at discharge (p=0.0116) following a mean 6.6 (7.36) days of Lantus. The final doses of Basalin and Lantus were similar (0.23 vs. 0.24 IU/kg/day; p=0.2409). Furthermore, reductions in pre- and post-prandial blood glucose were also observed between Basalin initiation, insulin switch and hospital discharge. The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was low during Basalin (2 [2.4%]) and Lantus (1 [1.2%]) treatment, with no cases of severe hypoglycemia. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this study population, switching from Basalin to Lantus was associated with further reductions in blood glucose, although the dose of insulin glargine did not increase. Further studies are required to verify these findings and determine the reason for this phenomenon.

Abstract 295. Title: A Cost-Utility Analysis of Switching from Reference to Biosimilar Infliximab Compared to Maintaining Reference Infliximab in Adult Patients with Crohn's Disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33644677
Abstract: Lower-cost biosimilar infliximab may address affordability concerns in the treatment of adults with Crohn's disease (CD), however, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of switching from reference to biosimilar is warranted. The aim of this research was to assess the incremental cost of switching from treatment with reference infliximab to biosimilar compared with maintaining reference infliximab in adults with CD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
A probabilistic cohort Markov model with 8-week cycle lengths was constructed to estimate the incremental costs and effects of switching over a 5-year time horizon from a public payer perspective. Base-case clinical inputs were obtained from NOR-SWITCH subgroup analyses and other published trials. Costs were obtained from Canadian sources. A total of 10,000 simulations were run. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the results to variations in uncertain parameters.
Switching to biosimilar infliximab was less costly but also less effective with incremental savings of $46,194 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $42,420, $50,455) and a loss in QALYs of -0.13 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.07). Eighty-three per cent of the simulations demonstrated incremental cost savings and an incremental loss of effectiveness. The model was sensitive to differences in rates of disease worsening between reference and biosimilar infliximab.
While biosimilar infliximab is associated with incremental savings for patients on maintenance therapy who are switched from reference infliximab, funding decision makers must decide whether a small loss of effectiveness is justified. Further evidence will help to inform reimbursement policy.

Abstract 296. Title: Adalimumab Biosimilars in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review of the Evidence for Biosimilarity.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33263165
Abstract: Although treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) has significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients do not have access to these treatments. As cost-effective alternatives to their reference products (RPs), biosimilars provide an opportunity to increase access to bDMARDs. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration have detailed pathways for the approval of biosimilars based on establishing the similarity of the biosimilar to the RP in terms of structure and function, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. A number of biosimilars of adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, and rituximab RPs have been approved in the United States and/or European Union. This article is focused on the seven adalimumab biosimilars. A review of the data for the biosimilars FKB327, ABP 501, BI 695501, GP2017, MSB11022, PF-06410293, and SB5 confirm that these products are highly similar to the adalimumab RP with regard to structure, physicochemical and biological properties, PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in the treatment of RA and other chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory conditions. Data from several switching studies showed no changes in efficacy, safety, trough serum drug concentration, or immunogenicity between the biosimilars and their RP.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02260791, NCT02405780, NCT01970475, NCT02137226, NCT02045979, NCT02744755, NCT02144714, NCT02167139, NCT03014947, NCT02114931, NCT02640612, NCT02167139, NCT03052322, NCT02480153.

Abstract 297. Title: Health-related quality of life and costs of switching originator infliximab to biosimilar one in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2020-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31914087
Abstract: Effectiveness, efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has been shown in previous studies. Limited data exist on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of switching originator to biosimilar infliximab (IFX) in IBD patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate impact of switching originator to biosimilar IFX on HRQoL, disease activity, and health care costs in IBD maintenance treatment.In this single-center prospective observational study, all IBD patients receiving maintenance IFX therapy were switched to biosimilar IFX. HRQoL was measured using the generic 15D health-related quality of life instrument (15D) utility measurement and the disease-specific Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) or Partial Mayo Score (pMayo), and fecal calprotectin (FC) served for evaluation of disease activity. Data were collected at time of switching and 3 and 12 months after switching. Patients' characteristics, clinical background information and costs were collected from patient records and the hospital's electronic database.Fifty-four patients were included in the analysis. No statistically significant changes were observed in 15D, CDAI, pMayo, and FC during 1-year follow-up. IBDQ scores were higher (P = .018) in Crohn disease 3 months after switching than at time of switching. Costs of biosimilar IFX were one-third of costs of originator one. Total costs related to secondary health care (excluding costs of IFX), were similar before and after the onset of biosimilar IFX.HRQoL and disease activity were after switching from originator to biosimilar IFX comparable, but the costs of biosimilar IFX were only one-third of those of the originator one.

Abstract 298. Title: Policy Options for Infliximab Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Given Emerging Evidence for Switching.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411318
Abstract: Biosimilars are becoming increasingly available internationally as patents expire on the originator biologic drugs they are intended to copy. Although substitution policies seen with generic drugs are being considered as a means to reduce expenditures on biologics, some biosimilars pose particular challenges in that the act of substitution may eventually lead to increased rates of therapeutic failure. As evidence requirements from regulators do not directly address this challenge, switch trials of biosimilars have emerged that may provide further answers. Using infliximab in inflammatory bowel disease as an example, we critically examine emerging evidence from two key switch trials (NOR-SWITCH and NCT020968610) and discuss the clinical and economic implications of these and what policy options may be most reasonable for payers. Options include reimbursing biosimilars for only newly diagnosed patients, using product-listing agreements to manage uncertainty, or using tiered co-payments or other incentives to promote biosimilar use.

Abstract 299. Title: Switching to less expensive blindness drug could save medicare part B $18 billion over a ten-year period.
Publication Date: 2014-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24889941
Abstract: The biologic drugs bevacizumab and ranibizumab have revolutionized treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, leading causes of blindness. Ophthalmologic use of these drugs has increased and now accounts for roughly one-sixth of the Medicare Part B drug budget. The two drugs have similar efficacy and potentially minor differences in adverse-event rates; however, at $2,023 per dose, ranibizumab costs forty times more than bevacizumab. Using modeling methods, we predict ten-year (2010-20) population-level costs and health benefits of using bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Our results show that if all patients were treated with the less expensive bevacizumab instead of current usage patterns, savings would amount to $18 billion for Medicare Part B and nearly $5 billion for patients. With an additional $6 billion savings in other health care expenses, the total savings would be almost $29 billion. Altering patterns of use with these therapies by encouraging bevacizumab use and hastening approval of biosimilar therapies would dramatically reduce spending without substantially affecting patient outcomes.

Abstract 300. Title: Infection, malignancy, switching, biosimilars, antibody formation, drug survival and withdrawal, and dose reduction: what have we learned over the last year about tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis?
Publication Date: 2016-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26927443
Abstract: This article reviews the most current studies investigating the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Studies over the past year have clarified that suppressing TNF with monoclonal antibodies does increase infection risk, yet coupled with reduction in disease activity and less use of corticosteroids as a consequence, the overall risk to the population is balanced. With caution (provided by some recent studies) TNFi agents can be reduced (dosage intervals lengthened) and maintain benefit. Biosimilars, not surprisingly, are going to be therapeutically identical to the innovator, and not more of a risk for causing antibodies to interfere with benefit. Uncertainty remains about when and how to make the switch.
TNFi agents have made their powerful impact on management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but questions remain: what is their true infection and malignancy risk in the evolving populations using these drugs today; are we able to maintain their benefit with a reduced schedule (and presumed less cost) and yet recapture their benefit if we guess wrong; are biosimilars just as good, or even better with less cost; are there data to inform us about how to achieve successful switching among different mechanism of action TNFi agents? Finally, are we going to face the specter of cost containment causing change from innovator to biosimilars over which we have no control?

Abstract 301. Title: Biosimilars in ulcerative colitis: When and for who?
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30060937
Abstract: The introduction of biological agents has revolutionized the management of ulcerative colitis (UC). Biosimilars are considered to be equivalent to the reference biologic products in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, clinical effectiveness and safety and have now been approved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). CT-P13 was the first biosimilar to infliximab that obtained regulatory approval by the EMA and US FDA. Accumulating data on biosimilars led to an increased acceptance amongst practicing gastroenterologists and their use can be associated with a potential reduction in healthcare costs. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on biosimilar use in UC. Authors review the existing data on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of biosimilar infliximab and adalimumab agents. Emerging data suggests that switching from originator to biosimilar is safe for CT-P13 infliximab, however data on other biosimilars, multiple-switching, reverse-switching, or cross-switching between biosimilars is lacking. The pathway for interchangeability of biosimilars is different in the US and Europe and many aspects have yet to be clarified by federal regulators. Since the approval of the first biosimilar, the biosimilar concept seems to be successful and has led to an increased use of biosimilar drugs in the treatment of UC worldwide with a better access for patients to biologic. Real-world data from prospective observational studies for 'follow-on' biosimilars is needed to ensure that safety, efficacy and immunogenicity is comparable to the originator in IBD, and that switching from the originator or among biosimilars is a safe option.

Abstract 302. Title: Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Switched From Maintenance Therapy With a Biosimilar to Remicade.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30630103
Abstract: There is evidence that it is safe and effective for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) to switch from maintenance therapy with an original infliximab drug to a biosimilar, but little is known about outcomes of reverse switches and/or multiple switches. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a reverse switch (from a biosimilar to Remicade) in a real-life cohort.
We performed a prospective observational study of 174 unselected and consecutive patients with IBD (136 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 38 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) who received maintenance therapy with the biosimilar in Hungary. In September 2017, patients were switched from the biosimilar (CT-P13) to Remicade, due to reimbursement policies. In our cohort, 8% (n = 14) patients had been previously exposed to the originator Remicade. We collected clinical and biochemical information from patients at baseline (time of the switch) and 16 and 24 weeks thereafter. Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's disease activity index <150 points or no fistula drainage, or a partial Mayo score <3 points for patients with UC. Serum drug trough levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured at baseline and week 16.
There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients in clinical remission at week 8 before the switch (82.5% with CD and 82.9% with UC), at baseline (80.6% with CD and 81.6% with UC), at week 16 (77.5% with CD and 83.7% with UC), or at week 24 (CD 76.3% with CD and 84.9% with UC) (P = .60 among groups for patients with CD and P = .98 among groups for patients with UC). For all patients, mean serum trough levels of infliximab were 5.33 ± 4.70 μg/mL at baseline and 5.69 ± 4.94 μg/mL at week 16 (P = .71); we did not find significant differences in prevalence of anti-drug antibody at baseline (16.2%) compared with week 16 (16.9%) (P = .87). Four infusion reactions occurred, until week 24 of follow up. There was no difference in outcomes or trough or antidrug antibody levels between patients with or without previous exposure to Remicade.
We collected data from a real-life cohort of patients with CD or UC who were switched from maintenance therapy with a biosimilar to Remicade or were treated with only Remicade. No significant changes were observed in remission, trough levels, or antidrug antibodies in patients switched from the biosimilar to Remicade. No new safety signals were detected.

Abstract 303. Title: In Search of Predictors of Switching Between Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents in Clinical Practice: A Multi-Regional Cohort Study.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31595485
Abstract: Switching between different erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) during the first year of therapy is frequent (15-20%), much more so toward reference products than biosimilars. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency and identify the potential predictors of switching between biosimilar and originator ESAs during the first year of treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), or chemotherapy-related anemia from six large Italian geographic areas in the years 2009-2015.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using six Italian regional claims databases (≥ 13 million inhabitants) during 2009-2015. Among incident epoetin users, the frequency of single, multiple, and backward switch during the first year of treatment was evaluated. Using frailty Cox models, potential predictors of first switch were identified. All analyses were stratified by the main indications for use.
Among 102,240 incident epoetin users, 15,853 (15.5%) switched to another epoetin during the first year of therapy; only 18% of these switched to biosimilars. Single switch was more common (62.2% of the switchers) than multiple (23.5%) or backward switch (14.3%). In cancer, the cumulative number of transfusions and iron preparations dispensed, as well as hyperparathyroidism, were predictors of switching. In CKD, the cumulative number of transfusions, number of vitamin A/D preparations dispensed, and CKD severity increased the probability of switching.
Switching between ESAs was frequent in both CKD and cancer patients. The number of cumulative transfusions and severity of disease seemed to affect the switch.

Abstract 304. Title: Safety of Biologics, Including Biosimilars: Perspectives on Current Status and Future Direction.
Publication Date: 2018-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29796832
Abstract: In recent years, marketing of highly innovative and costly biologics improved the management of high-burden diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, and chronic renal failure. Several widely prescribed biologics have recently lost or will shortly lose their patents, thus opening avenues to the marketing of a growing number of biosimilars worldwide, which are products similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to already licensed reference products, thus allowing for potential savings in pharmaceutical expenditure. Numerous debates about the interchangeability between biosimilars and reference products are still ongoing, owing to concerns about potential immunogenicity raised by switching, which may cause a lack of effect and toxicity. Patients successfully treated with biologic therapy may theoretically receive biosimilars to contain costs, if reference product and related biosimilar are judged as interchangeable. However, the positions of regulatory agencies on the interchangeability and automatic substitution of biologics with biosimilars are very different. The benefit-risk profile of biosimilars has been often questioned by clinicians owing to the limited amount of pre-marketing information on clinical efficacy and safety, despite biosimilarity being based on a comparability exercise with the reference product to gain the biosimilar approval. Nevertheless, after more than 10 years of marketing from the first biosimilar approval in Europe, no proof of differences in terms of the safety profile of biosimilars and originators has been reported. In this context, post-marketing evaluation of both biologics and biosimilars safety profiles through analyses from spontaneous reporting databases and claims databases is crucial. An important issue for the pharmacovigilance of biologics concerns the traceability, indicating the brand name and batch number in spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, but this requirement is not frequently addressed. This review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics and potential challenges in the safety profile assessment of biologics with a focus on the post-marketing setting.

Abstract 305. Title: How Much Are Biosimilars Used in Clinical Practice? A Retrospective Italian Population-Based Study of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents in the Years 2009-2013.
Publication Date: 2015-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169209
Abstract: To explore the prescription patterns of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in four large Italian geographic areas, where different health policy interventions to promote biosimilar use in routine care are undertaken.
A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted during the years 2009-2013. The data sources were the administrative databases of the Tuscany region and of the Caserta, Palermo, and Treviso Local Health Units (LHUs). The characteristics, prevalence, and switching patterns of different ESAs (biosimilars and reference products), stratified by indication for use, were calculated over time and across centers.
Overall, 49,491 patients were treated with ESAs during the years 2009-2013 in the four centers. Of these, 41,286 patients (83.4 %) were naive users. The prevalence of ESA use increased from 2.9 to 3.4 per 1000 inhabitants in the years 2009-2011 but decreased thereafter (3.0 per 1000 in 2013). Moreover, the proportion of biosimilar users increased overall from 1.8 % in 2010 to 33.6 % in 2013, with larger increase in Treviso (from 0.0 to 45.0 %) and Tuscany (from 0.7 to 37.6 %) than in Caserta (from 7.5 to 22.9 %) and Palermo (from 0.0 to 27.7 %). Switching between different ESAs during the first year of therapy was frequent (17.0 %), much more toward reference products than toward biosimilars.
Overall, the prevalence of ESA use decreased slightly, while use of biosimilar ESAs, especially in naive patients, increased significantly but to different extents in these four large Italian geographic areas. Switching between different ESAs during the first year of treatment was very frequent, which may affect pharmacovigilance monitoring. New strategies are necessary to further improve market penetration of low-cost medicines, such as biosimilars, and also to harmonize effective health policy interventions that aim to reduce pharmaceutical expenses and optimize patient benefit across all regions.

Abstract 306. Title: Biosimilar infliximab CPT-13 for inflammatory bowel disease in a real clinical setting: pharmacokinetic outcomes, immunogenicity, and drug survival.
Publication Date: 2021-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33486961
Abstract: efficacy and safety were evaluated after switching to a biosimilar infliximab (CPT-13) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, few cohort studies compare the pharmacokinetic profiles, immunogenicity, and safety of the reference infliximab (IFX) and CPT-13 in a real clinical setting.
to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles and drug survival on the long term of reference IFX and CPT-13 at weeks 54 and 104. A secondary objective was to determine the long-term immunogenicity and safety profile of CPT-13 in patients with IBD in a real clinical setting.
a retrospective, observational cohort analysis was performed in a single center, including patients with IBD under treatment with reference IFX or CPT-13. Serum drug concentrations were compared to determine if there were any significant differences in pharmacokinetic outcomes between reference IFX and CPT-13 at 26, 54, 78, and 104 weeks. The drug survival of reference IFX and CPT-13 was determined at weeks 54 and 104.
one hundred and six patients were included during the study period. Forty-five (42.5 %) patients received CPT-13 and 61 (57.5 %) received reference IFX. A total of 347 serum samples were analyzed and no significant differences were observed between reference IFX and CPT-13. The percentage of patients who achieved serum concentrations within the target therapeutic range was similar in both groups (74.1 % for reference IFX and 72.5 % for CPT-13, p = 0.741). At week 54, withdrawal rates for reference IFX and CPT-13 were 11.5 % and 20.0 %, respectively (p = 0.226), whereas at week 104 they were 26.2 % and 28.9 %, respectively (p = 0.761).
the pharmacokinetic characteristics and incidence of immunogenicity of CPT-13 in a real clinical setting are comparable to those of the infliximab originator. The two products also have similar long-term drug survival and the same safety profile.

Abstract 307. Title: Patient Access, Unmet Medical Need, Expected Benefits, and Concerns Related to the Utilisation of Biosimilars in Eastern European Countries: A Survey of Experts.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29546072
Abstract: This policy research aims to map patient access barriers to biologic treatments, to explore how increased uptake of biosimilars may lower these hurdles and to identify factors limiting the increased utilisation of biosimilars. A policy survey was developed to review these questions in 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Two experts (one public and one private sector representative) from each country completed the survey. Questions were related to patient access, purchasing, clinical practice, and real-world data collection on both original biologics and biosimilars. Restrictions on the number of patients that can be treated and related waiting lists were reported as key patient access barriers. According to respondents, for both clinicians and payers the primary benefit of switching patients to biosimilars would be to treat more patients. However, concerns with therapeutic equivalence and fear of immunogenicity may reduce utilisation of biosimilars. Similar limitations in patient access to both original biologics and biosimilars raise concerns about the appropriateness and success of current biosimilar policies in CEE and CIS countries. The conceptual framework for additional real-world data collection exists in all countries which may provide a basis for future risk-management activities including vigorous pharmacovigilance data collection.

Abstract 308. Title: Is there a reason for concern or is it just hype? - A systematic literature review of the clinical consequences of switching from originator biologics to biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28650704
Abstract: While prescribing biosimilars to patients naive to a biologic treatment is a well-accepted practice, switching clinically stable patients from an originator to a biosimilar is an issue for clinicians. Well-designed clinical trials and real-world data which study the consequences of switching from an originator biologic treatment to its biosimilar alternative are limited, especially for monoclonal antibodies. Areas covered: A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed to identify evidence of the consequences of switching from original biologics to biosimilars. References of included papers were also scrutinized. After a title-, abstract- and full text screening, out of the 153 original hits and 77 additional ones from screening the references, 58 papers (12 empirical papers, 5 systematic reviews and 41 non-empirical papers) were included. Expert opinion: Preventing patients on biologic medicines from switching to biosimilars due to anticipated risks seems to be disproportional compared to the expected cost savings and/or improved patient access. Indeed, it is the opinion of the authors that the concern of switching to biosimilars is overhyped.

Abstract 309. Title: Biosimilars in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: initial lessons from the first approved biosimilar anti-tumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody.
Publication Date: 2016-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26403380
Abstract: The introduction of targeted biological therapies has revolutionised the management of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Following treatment with these therapies, many patients experience significant improvements in different aspects of their disease, including symptoms, work productivity and other outcomes relevant for individuals and society. However, due to the complexity of biological drug development and manufacturing processes, the costs of these therapies are relatively high. Indeed, the financial burden on healthcare systems due to biological therapies is considerable and lack of patient access to effective treatment remains a concern in many parts of the world. As many reference biological therapies have now reached or are near to patent expiry, a number of 'biosimilar' drugs have been developed for use in various clinical settings, and some of these drugs are already in use in several countries. While the potential pharmacoeconomic benefits of cost-effective biosimilars seem clear, several issues have been raised regarding, for example, the definition of biosimilarity and the validity of indication extrapolation, as well as the 'switchability' and relative immunogenicity of biosimilars and their reference drugs. In this review, these issues will be discussed with reference to CT-P13, a biosimilar of the anti-tumour necrosis factor monoclonal antibody infliximab, which is approved in Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of various IMIDs. Other important issues, including those related to data collection during nonclinical and clinical development of biosimilars, are also discussed.

Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> We compared the clinical course of type 2 diabetic patients whose basal insulin preparations were replaced from insulin glargine (IGlar) 100 units/mL (U100) to IGlar biosimilar or IGlar 300 units/mL (U300). <b>Methods:</b> After propensity score matching, 34 patients whose basal insulin preparation was switched from IGlar U100 to IGlar biosimilar and 102 switched to IGlar U300 were observed for 6 months. <b>Results:</b> The HbA1c level and body weight did not change significantly after the replacement in the IGlar biosimilar or IGlar U300 groups. In the IGlar biosimilar group, the frequency of subjects who experienced hypoglycemia after the replacement (12%) was not different from before (12%). However, the frequency was significantly lower after the replacement (2%) than before (13%) in the IGlar U300 group. The change in the HbA1c level after the replacement showed a significant association with the HbA1c level at the baseline but not with the kind of IGlar. Hypoglycemia was frequently observed in subjects who had experienced hypoglycemia before the replacement. <b>Conclusions:</b> IGlar biosimilar and IGlar U300 induced similar HbA1c and body weight changes among type 2 diabetic patients. IGlar biosimilar is a suitable option for patients with a low risk for hypoglycemia.

Abstract 311. Title: Experience with Biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) in Norway.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28147374
Abstract: The first monoclonal antibody biosimilar to be used in clinical practice is the tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor Remsima® (CT-P13). The drug is approved for all indications as the originator infliximab (Remicade®) although clinical efficacy has been demonstrated only in rheumatic diseases. Since the fall of 2013, Remsima® has been available in Norway and from January 2014, it has been the drug of choice when initiating biological treatment in biologics naïve patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, many gastroenterologists have been greatly concerned about the extrapolation of indication. Switching between Remsima® and the innovator product is another issue that has been discussed. Key Messages: Good efficacy, tolerability and safety were demonstrated in a prospective observational study of IBD patients with moderate to severe disease activity. After 14 weeks of treatment there was a significant reduction in the Harvey Bradshaw index in patients with Crohns disease (CD) and reduction in the partial Mayo score and simple clinical colitis activity index in patients with ulcerative colitis. In both patient groups, there was also a significant reduction in fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein (CRP). In another observational study, IBD patients on maintenance treatment with Remicade® were switched to Remsima®. By comparing values before and after switch, no changes in activity indices, CRP or calprotectin were observed. However, a significant increase in infliximab trough levels was shown in the CD group. No unexpected adverse events occurred after switching.
Based on our experience in Norway, Remsima® seems to be efficacious and well tolerated in IBD. The increasing use of Remsima® in clinical practice has also contributed to significant cost savings on the health budget. Results from the NOR-SWITCH study will be available during 2016 and will hopefully contribute to answer some of the important questions that have been raised following the introduction of biosimilars as a treatment option for IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Abstract 312. Title: Drug safety and immunogenicity of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors: the story so far.
Publication Date: 2018-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29325166
Abstract: TNF-α inhibitor (TNFi) therapies have transformed the treatment of several rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases. However, the majority of TNFi's are immunogenic and consequent anti-drug antibodies formation can impact on both treatment efficacy and safety. Several controversies exist in the area of immunogenicity of TNFis and drug safety. While anti-drug antibodies to TNFis have been described in association with infusion reactions; serious adverse events (AEs) such as thromboembolic events, lupus-like syndrome, paradoxical AEs, for example, vasculitis-like events and other autoimmune manifestations have also been reported. The expansion of the biologic armamentarium, new treatment strategies such as introduction/switching to biosimilars and cost-saving approaches such as TNFi tapering, may all have a potential impact on immunogenicity and clinical sequelae. In this review we evaluate how evolution of biologics relates to drug safety and immunogenicity, appraise relevant evidence from trials, spontaneous pharmacovigilance and observational studies and outline the areas of uncertainty that still exist.

Abstract 313. Title: Switch from reference etanercept to SDZ ETN, an etanercept biosimilar, does not impact efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis: 48-week results from the phase III, randomized, double-blind EQUIRA study.
Publication Date: 2019-May-28
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138316
Abstract: Sandoz etanercept (SDZ ETN; GP2015) is an etanercept biosimilar with equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity to reference etanercept (ETN) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
EQUIRA was a phase III, double-blind study conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous 50 mg SDZ ETN or ETN, once-weekly, for 24 weeks. At week 24, patients with at least moderate EULAR response in the SDZ ETN group continued SDZ ETN treatment, and those in the ETN group were switched to receive 50 mg SDZ ETN, for up to 48 weeks. Patients received concomitant methotrexate at a stable dose (10-25 mg/week) and folic acid (≥ 5 mg/week). Equivalence between SDZ ETN and ETN for change from baseline in disease activity score including 28 joint count C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at week 24 (primary endpoint) and comparable safety and immunogenicity profile of SDZ ETN and ETN have previously been demonstrated at week 24. Herein, we present the 48-week results of the study after a single switch from ETN to its biosimilar at week 24.
The least squares mean (standard error) change in DAS28-CRP from baseline up to week 48 was comparable between "continued SDZ ETN" (- 2.90 [0.12], n = 148) and "switched to SDZ ETN" (- 2.78 [0.13], n = 131) groups. The proportion of patients achieving EULAR good/moderate responses based on DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/50/70 response rates were comparable between the two groups. The proportion of patients with at least one treatment-emergent adverse event was 42.9% in the "continued SDZ ETN" and 38.0% in the "switched to SDZ ETN" groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients in each of the two groups. After week 24, none of the patients in the switched group developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), while 4 patients in the continued SDZ ETN group had single-event, very low titer, non-neutralizing ADAs detected.
The 48-week results from the EQUIRA study demonstrate that switch from ETN to SDZ ETN in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis does not impact the efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity of etanercept.

Abstract 315. Title: The Budget Impact of Biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) for the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases in Five European Countries.
Publication Date: 2015-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26343027
Abstract: Inflammatory autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis) have a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and healthcare budgets. Biosimilar infliximab (Remsima(®)) has been authorized by the European Medicines Agency for the management of inflammatory autoimmune diseases based on a data package demonstrating efficacy, safety, and quality comparable to the reference infliximab product (Remicade(®)). This analysis aims to estimate the 1-year budget impact of the introduction of Remsima in five European countries.
A budget impact model for the introduction of Remsima in Germany, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium was developed over a 1-year time horizon. Infliximab-naïve and switch patient groups were considered. Only direct drug costs were included. The model used the drug-acquisition cost of Remicade. The list price of Remsima was not known at the time of the analysis, and was assumed to be 10-30% less than that of Remicade. Key variables were tested in the sensitivity analysis.
The annual cost savings resulting from the introduction of Remsima were projected to range from €2.89 million (Belgium, 10% discount) to €33.80 million (Germany, 30% discount). If any such savings made were used to treat additional patients with Remsima, 250 (Belgium, 10% discount) to 2602 (Germany, 30% discount) additional patients could be treated. The cumulative cost savings across the five included countries and the six licensed disease areas were projected to range from €25.79 million (10% discount) to €77.37 million (30% discount). Sensitivity analyses showed the number of patients treated with infliximab to be directly correlated with projected cost savings, with disease prevalence and patient weight having a smaller impact, and incidence the least impact.
The introduction of Remsima could lead to considerable drug cost-related savings across the six licensed disease areas in the five European countries.

Abstract 316. Title: A cost-consequence analysis of the preferential use of secukinumab versus adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
Publication Date: 2021-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34756316
Abstract: To assess the efficiency of secukinumab compared to adalimumab as first biologic treatment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) perspective.
A cost-consequence analysis of the cost and clinical response of two treatment strategies was conducted over a 2-year time horizon. A hypothetical cohort of 10 patients with PsA initiated treatment with secukinumab 150mg (cohort A) or adalimumab 40mg (cohort B), respectively. Patients achieving clinical response (ACR20/50/70) at week 24 continued the initial treatment, while patients with inadequate response switched to secukinumab 300mg. Pharmacological costs were calculated based on SmPC (notified ex-factory price). The lowest cost of adalimumab biosimilar was considered. Data on clinical response were extracted from the two matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) published comparing secukinumab vs adalimumab. Results were expressed as the cost difference between the two cohorts (€, 2019) and were calculated for each clinical response criteria (ACR20/50/70) and for each MAIC. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of potential discounts on the cost of adalimumab while maintaining the cost of secukinumab unchanged.
Depending on the MAIC used, the cost of initiating biologic treatment for PsA with secukinumab 150mg was 18-33% lower than the one estimated for adalimumab 40mg, for ACR20, 18-28% for ACR50, and 16-23% for ACR70 response rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that it would be necessary a discount of 40-60%, 40-65% and 50-75% over the adalimumab cost to compensate for the differences in efficacy observed for ACR20/50/70, respectively, depending on the MAIC used.
In patients with PsA, secukinumab could be considered a more efficient first-line biologic treatment compared to adalimumab, from the SNHS perspective.

Abstract 317. Title: Efficacy and Safety of CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease after Switching from Originator Infliximab: Exploratory Analyses from the NOR-SWITCH Main and Extension Trials.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32965617
Abstract: The NOR-SWITCH main and extension trials demonstrated that switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) is efficacious and safe across six diseases. However, a subgroup analysis of Crohn's disease (CD) in the main trial displayed a close to significant difference favouring originator infliximab, and more scientific data have therefore been requested.
The aim was to assess treatment efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in an explorative subgroup analysis in CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the NOR-SWITCH trials.
The 52-week, randomised, non-inferiority, double-blind, multicentre, phase 4 NOR-SWITCH study was followed by a 26-week open extension trial where all patients received treatment with CT-P13. Treatment efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in CD and UC were assessed throughout the 78-week study period.
The main and extension trials included 155 and 93 patients with CD and 93 and 80 patients with UC, respectively. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable in both treatment arms within patient groups. There were no differences in the main and extension trials regarding changes in activity indices, C-reactive protein, faecal calprotectin, patient's and physician's global assessment of disease activity and patient-reported outcome measures in CD and UC. Moreover, comparable results were also demonstrated for trough serum levels, presence of anti-drug antibodies, and reported adverse events.
Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of both the originator and biosimilar infliximab were comparable in CD and UC in the NOR-SWITCH main and extension trials. These explorative subgroup analyses confirm that there are no significant concerns related to switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 in CD and UC.

Abstract 318. Title: Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 compared with maintained treatment with originator infliximab (NOR-SWITCH): a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-10
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28502609
Abstract: TNF inhibitors have improved treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and chronic plaque psoriasis, but are expensive therapies. The aim of NOR-SWITCH was to examine switching from originator infliximab to the less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 regarding efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.
The study is a randomised, non-inferiority, double-blind, phase 4 trial with 52 weeks of follow-up. Adult patients on stable treatment with infliximab originator treated in a hospital setting for at least 6 months were eligible for participation. Patients with informed consent were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either continued infliximab originator or to switch to CT-P13 treatment, with unchanged dosing regimen. Data were collected at infusion visits in 40 Norwegian study centres. Patients, assessors, and patient care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was disease worsening during 52-week follow-up. 394 patients in the primary per-protocol set were needed to show a non-inferiority margin of 15%, assuming 30% disease worsening in each group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02148640.
Between Oct 24, 2014, and July 8, 2015, 482 patients were enrolled and randomised (241 to infliximab originator, 241 to CT-P13 group; one patient was excluded from the full analysis and safety set for CT-P13) and 408 were included in the per-protocol set (202 in the infliximab originator group and 206 in the CT-P13 group). 155 (32%) patients in the full analysis set had Crohn's disease, 93 (19%) had ulcerative colitis, 91 (19%) had spondyloarthritis, 77 (16%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 30 (6%) had psoriatic arthritis, and 35 (7%) had chronic plaque psoriasis. Disease worsening occurred in 53 (26%) patients in the infliximab originator group and 61 (30%) patients in the CT-P13 group (per-protocol set; adjusted treatment difference -4·4%, 95% CI -12·7 to 3·9). The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups (for serious adverse events, 24 [10%] for infliximab originator vs 21 [9%] for CT-P13; for overall adverse events, 168 [70%] vs 164 [68%]; and for adverse events leading to discontinuation, nine [4%] vs eight [3%], respectively).
The NOR-SWITCH trial showed that switching from infliximab originator to CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab originator according to a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15%. The study was not powered to show non-inferiority in individual diseases.

Abstract 319. Title: An application of Nano Differential Scanning Fluorimetry for Higher Order Structure assessment between mAb originator and biosimilars: Trastuzumab and Rituximab as case studies.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32380351
Abstract: Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) or thermal shift has emerged in recent years as a high-throughput screening method in biotherapeutic formulation studies. The present article reports on a fast-track assessment platform for rapid investigation of therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with minimal sample concentration, volume, and preparation. The proposed nanoDSF platform has been demonstrated for rapid assessment of two commercial IgG 1 drug products (DP), trastuzumab and rituximab, and their biosimilars with respect to their conformational and colloidal stability. Domain specific differences for each of the IgGs have been elucidated with respect to onset of domain unfolding (T<sub>onset</sub>) and melting temperatures. These thermal unfolding and transition midpoint (T<sub>m</sub>) measurements are based on the intrinsic aromatic amino acid residue fluorescence of proteins. Moreover, to understand the possibility of nanoDSF as a predictive tool, data from nanoDSF has been correlated with accelerated stability studies. Melting temperatures across brands were found to be highly comparable to the rate of heating, thereby exhibiting a significant domain specific effect on melting temperatures for both trastuzumab and rituximab. Conservation of higher order structure (HOS) through reversible unfolding was also examined and both the mAbs were found to regain tertiary structure up till the first transition midpoint. No clear correlation was found between formation of higher molecular weight species (HMWS) and unfolding parameters (T<sub>onset</sub> and T<sub>agg</sub>) for accelerated stability studies. Finally, a discussion on the need for fast predictive assessment of conformation and colloidal stability as well as a comparison of advantages and limitations of the technique with routine/classical tools such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry and differential scanning calorimetry has been presented.

Abstract 321. Title: A Comprehensive Overview on Biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2016-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26916165
Abstract: Biosimilars are biotechnologically manufactured products that enter the market as and when the original biopharmaceutical goes off patent. As the name suggests, they are only "similar" and not exact versions of the originator product. The manufacturing process of biosimilars is complex, the product prone to variation, and regulatory approval rules are more extensive and elaborative than required for generic versions of chemically synthesized drugs. This makes the field of biosimilars interesting and inquisitive for research. As biosimilars are essentially protein drugs manufactured in living cells, immunogenicity becomes a major issue in almost all biopharmaceuticals. This increases the importance of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and pharmacovigilance. Since biosimilars are not identical copies of innovator products, the regulatory facets of indication extrapolation, automatic substitution, and interchangeability are more stringent than those available for small molecule generic drugs. This article discusses all these sectors significant to the world of biosimilars. Prospectively, biosimilars have the potential to deliver effective cost savings for healthcare users and thus they are a critical part of the biopharmaceutical industry.

Abstract 322. Title: Biosimilars: Review of current applications, obstacles, and their future in medicine.
Publication Date: 2018-Aug-16
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30148143
Abstract: Biosimilars are a growing drug class designed to be used interchangeably with biologics. Biologics are created in living cells and are typically large, complex proteins that may have a variety of uses. Within the field of gastroenterology alone, biologics are used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases, cancers, and endocrine disorders. While biologics have proven to be effective in treating or managing many diseases, patient access is often limited by high costs. The development of biosimilars is an attempt to reduce treatment costs. Biosimilars must be nearly identical to their reference biologics in terms of efficacy, side effect risk profile, and immunogenicity. Although the manufacturing process still involves production within living cells, biosimilars undergo fewer clinical trials than do their reference biologics. This ultimately reduces the cost of production and the cost of the biosimilar drug compared to its reference biologic. Currently, seven biosimilars have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer. There are other biologics involved in treating gastroenterologic diseases for which there are no FDA approved biosimilars. Although biosimilars have the potential to reduce healthcare costs in chronic disease management, they face challenges in establishing a significant market share. Physician comfort in prescribing reference biologics instead of biosimilars and patient reluctance to switch from a biologic to a biosimilar are two common contributing factors to biosimilars' slow increase in use. More time will be needed for biosimilars to establish a larger and more consistent market share compared to their reference biologics. Additional data confirming the safety and efficacy of biosimilars, increased number of available biosimilars, and further cost reduction of biosimilars will all be necessary to improve physician confidence in biosimilars and patient comfort with biosimilars.

Abstract 323. Title: Immunogenicity and loss of response to TNF inhibitors: implications for rheumatoid arthritis treatment.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-21
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29158574
Abstract: The availability of monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized the treatment of an increasingly broad spectrum of diseases. Inflammatory diseases are among those most widely treated with protein-based therapeutics, termed biologics. Following the first large-scale clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies performed in the 1990s by rheumatologists and clinical immunologists, the approval of these agents for use in daily clinical practice led to substantial progress in the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Despite this progress, however, only a proportion of patients achieve a long-term clinical response. Data on the use of agents blocking TNF, which were among the first biologics introduced into clinical practice, provide ample evidence of primary and secondary treatment inefficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Important issues relevant to primary and secondary failure of these agents in RA include immunogenicity, methodological problems for the detection of antidrug antibodies and trough drug levels, and the implications for treatment strategies. Although there is no strong evidence to support the routine estimation of antidrug antibodies or serum trough levels during anti-TNF therapy, these assessments might be helpful in a few clinical situations; in particular, they might guide decisions on switching the therapeutic biologic in certain instances of secondary clinical failure.

Abstract 324. Title: Effectiveness and safety of adalimumab biosimilar in inflammatory bowel disease: A multicenter study.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30645725
Abstract: Adalimumab has emerged as a useful drug for treating patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), not responding to conventional therapy. There is limited data on effectiveness and safety of adalimumab biosimilar in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Patients with IBD who received at least one dose of adalimumab biosimilar from October 2015 to February 2018 were retrospectively included in this multicenter data analysis. Its effectiveness in inducing and maintaining clinical remission at 8, 26, and 52 weeks for CD and UC and safety profile of the drug was studied.
Seventy patients (49 CD; 21 UC) with a median age of 39 (range 13-73) years, male predominance (64.3%), and median (IQR) disease duration of 72 (33-104) months were included. Adalimumab biosimilar was effective in inducing remission (at 8 weeks) in 46.9% and 52.4% patients with CD and UC, respectively, of whom  32.7% and 33.3% (three fourths of remitters) maintained remission over 1 year, respectively. Twenty (28.6%) patients experienced adverse events; seven (10%) were serious of whom  three had developed tuberculosis.
Adalimumab biosimilar in usual clinical practice is safe and effective in inducing and maintaining remission in Indian patients with IBD. Steroid-free clinical remission was observed in one third of patients with UC and CD at 1 year of therapy. Graphical Abstract.

Abstract 325. Title: A comparative study of PF-06438179/GP1111 (an infliximab biosimilar) and reference infliximab in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis: A subgroup analysis.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32476277
Abstract: PF-06438179/GP1111 (PF-SZ-IFX) is a biosimilar of reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup> ). This analysis compared the efficacy of PF-SZ-IFX and reference infliximab sourced from the European Union (IFX-EU) in patient subgroups from a randomized, comparative study of PF-SZ-IFX versus IFX-EU.
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized 1:1 to PF-SZ-IFX (n = 324) or IFX-EU (n = 326); study drug (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints such as American College of Rheumatology criteria for ≥20% clinical improvement (ACR20), change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, four components based on hs-CRP (DAS28-CRP) at weeks 14 and 30 were performed by age, gender, race, region, immunogenicity status, and treatment history.
Overall, ACR20 response rates as well as changes in DAS28-CRP and hs-CRP at week 14 were similar between PF-SZ-IFX and IFX-EU within the subgroups of age, gender, race, region, treatment history, and immunogenicity status. Results to week 30 support overall similarity in efficacy between the two treatment arms in all subgroups.
Overall, PF-SZ-IFX and IFX-EU were similar in efficacy within the analyzed subgroups of age, gender, race, region, treatment history, and immunogenicity status. The efficacy results from these subgroup analyses were aligned with the previously described results for the overall population up to week 30.

Abstract 326. Title: Long-term Outcomes After Switching to CT-P13 in Pediatric-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Single-Center Prospective Observational Study.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29390113
Abstract: The relatively high cost and patent expiry of infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has led to the development of biosimilar versions of the reference product (RP). This study investigated the long-term efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of CT-P13 after switching from infliximab RP in pediatric-onset IBD patients.
In this prospective observational study, patients with pediatric-onset IBD receiving maintenance infliximab RP were followed for 1 year after continuing infliximab RP (RP maintenance group) or switching to CT-P13 (CT-P13 switch group). Primary end points were the proportion of patients continuously receiving infliximab and the proportion achieving persistent remission-corticosteroid-free sustained clinical remission without dose intensification-at 1 year.
Thirty-six patients were recruited to the RP maintenance group and 38 to the CT-P13 switch group. At 1 year in the RP maintenance group and CT-P13 switch group, 86.1% (31/36) and 92.1% (35/38) patients had continuously received infliximab (P = 0.649), and 77.8% (28/36) and 78.9% (30/38) patients experienced persistent remission (P = 1.000), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in any measures of disease activity, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity between the time of switch and 1-year postswitch in the CT-P13 switch group. Twenty-seven adverse events occurred in the maintenance group and 30 in the switch group.
Switching from maintenance infliximab RP to CT-P13 did not result in any significant differences in efficacy, pharmacokinetics, or immunogenicity in patients with pediatric-onset IBD, and no unexpected safety issues occurred, supporting findings from randomized controlled trials.

Abstract 327. Title: Population pharmacokinetics of adalimumab biosimilar adalimumab-adbm and reference product in healthy subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis to assess pharmacokinetic similarity.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32363771
Abstract: Adalimumab-adbm is a monoclonal antibody developed as a biosimilar to adalimumab (Humira, AbbVie Inc.). The key objectives of this study were using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) approach to assess pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity between adalimumab-adbm and Humira in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to quantify the effects of potential covariates on adalimumab PK and to assess the impact of switching treatment from Humira to adalimumab-adbm on PK.
A PPK model was firstly developed using intensive PK data from the phase-1 study in healthy subjects (NCT02045979). PPK models were developed separately for phase-3 base study (NCT02137226) and its extension study (NCT02640612) in patients with active RA.
PPK models were developed for adalimumab from adalimumab-adbm and Humira treatment in healthy subjects and RA patients. Weight and anti-drug antibodies were found to be important predictors of adalimumab clearance. Adalimumab PK was similar between adalimumab-adbm and Humira. The estimated effect of Humira on clearance, relative to the adalimumab-adbm, was 1.02 (i.e., Humira has 0.02 greater clearance). Similarly, the effect of treatment arms (switching) on clearance was estimated to be 1.00 and 0.997 for Humira:Humira:BI and Humira:BI:BI arms, respectively, relative to the BI:BI:BI arm (BI refers to adalimumab-adbm) in the phase-3 extension study.
PK similarity between adalimumab-adbm and Humira in patients with active RA was demonstrated using PPK approach. Adalimumab PK was also similar when switching treatment from Humira to adalimumab-adbm at either week 24 or 48.

Abstract 328. Title: Biosimilar biological drugs in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31988667
Abstract: Within the last 20 years, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors have been proven to be effective in achieving and maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Since 2013, when infliximab originator lost its patent protection, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in Poland have also been treated with biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars are drugs with high similarity to their reference products in terms of physicochemical properties, including structure, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilars are approved for use on the basis of the same rigorous quality standards as their reference products. In 2018, also biosimilars of adalimumab have become available. Studies published to date have shown that biosimilars do not differ from reference drugs in terms of the efficacy and safety. There are numerous data to confirm that a single switch of biological drugs (mainly from reference to biosimilar drugs) has no effect on therapy efficacy and safety. However, a significantly lower cost of therapy with biosimilars not only allows us to treat a much larger number of patients but may also necessitate multiple switches from reference drugs to biosimilars (including biosimilars produced by different manufacturers). Recently, the first results have been published concerning multiple switches in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, no such data are currently available for patients with IBDs.

Abstract 329. Title: Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of infliximab biosimilar in comparison to originator biologic and adalimumab in patients with Crohn disease.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-29
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31316042
Abstract: An infliximab biosimilar has been shown to be equivalent to originator infliximab. However, data concerning the drug's efficacy and safety in patients with Crohn disease (CD) are still limited.
The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of an infliximab biosimilar in the Polish population with CD in comparison to its originator biologic and adalimumab.
This was a retrospective, single‑center study of 286 consecutive patients with CD. They received originator infliximab, an infliximab biosimilar, or adalimumab on the basis of the same inclusion criteria. Disease activity was estimated at baseline, after induction therapy, after 1 year of treatment, and during 12 months of follow‑up.
There were no differences in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index in patients treated with infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, or adalimumab. Clinical response, clinical remission, and glucocorticoid‑free remission rates were also comparable between groups. The relapse rate was similar in groups receiving infliximab biosimilar and adalimumab (54% and 61%, respectively), with relapses occurring more often in patients receiving infliximab (83% of patients during 12‑month follow‑up; P <0.001).
We showed the same efficacy and safety of the infliximab biosimilar in comparison to the originator drug and adalimumab in the Polish population, not only during induction and 1‑year therapy, but also during 12‑month follow‑up.

Abstract 330. Title: Adoption of Biosimilar Infliximab for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in the EU5: A Budget Impact Analysis Using a Delphi Panel.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28620302
Abstract: <b>Introduction:</b> Introducing biosimilar infliximab for the treatment in rheumatology (rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis) and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) may reduce treatment costs associated with biologics. This study aimed to investigate the budget impact of adopting biosimilar infliximab in five European countries, considering that the budget impact includes the adoption of biosimilar infliximab and the availability of biologic alternatives such as vedolizumab, biosimilar etanercept, biosimilar rituximab, and other relevant factors. <b>Methods:</b> An existing budget impact model was adapted to forecast the budget impact in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. Epidemiological parameters were derived from published literature reviewed in July 2015. Current market shares of biologics were derived from Therapy Watch (2012/2013 data). Respondents in a Delphi panel, conducted in 2015 and consisting of several leading rheumatologists and gastroenterologists from different nationalities, were asked to forecast uptake of biosimilar infliximab and estimate the proportion of patients eligible for a particular type of biological treatment, including biosimilar infliximab. Scenario analyses assessed the influence of various factors, including price reductions, on the budget. <b>Results:</b> Uptake of biosimilar infliximab was particularly expected for naïve patients; switching patients that already received other biologics was not expected much. Market shares after 5 years of biosimilar infliximab were ~2% in rheumatology in all five countries and in gastroenterology ranged from 4% in France to over 30% in Italy. Except for France, budgets were expected to decrease for rheumatologic diseases. For gastroenterology, budgets were expected to decrease in Spain and Italy. Budgets were expected to increase substantially in the UK and Germany, due to the introduction of vedolizumab in the studied period. In France, budget was expected to slightly increase for ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's Disease, and ulcerative collitis. Savings in budget were expected in all countries, for all diseases, when larger price discounts on biosimilar infliximab were used. <b>Discussion and Conclusion:</b> This study has shown that only when price reductions are large enough (i.e., 50% or more), physicians indicated that they will prescribe biosimilars. Policy makers should ensure substantial price reductions and stimulate physicians to use biosimilar products, to obtain savings in healthcare budgets.

Abstract 331. Title: The Argument Against a Biosimilar Switch Policy for Infliximab in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Living in Alberta.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905124
Abstract: A nonmedical switch policy is currently being considered in Alberta, which would force patients on originator biologics to biosimilar alternatives with the hypothetical aim of reducing costs to the health care system. The evidence to support the safety of nonmedical switching in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of low to very low quality; in fact, existing data suggest a potential risk of harm. In a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials, one patient would lose response to infliximab for every 11 patients undergoing nonmedical switching. Switching to a biosimilar has important logistical and ethical implications including potential forced treatment changes without appropriate patient consent and unfairly penalizing patients living in rural areas and those without private drug insurance. Even in the best-case scenario, assuming perfectly executed switching without logistical delays, we predict switching 2,000 patients with Remicade will lead to over 60 avoidable surgeries in Alberta. Furthermore, nonmedical switching has not been adequately studied in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and elderly patients. While the crux of the argument for nonmedical switching is cost savings, biosimilar switching may not be cost effective: Particularly when originator therapies are being offered at the same price as biosimilars. Canadian patients with IBD have been surveyed, and their response is clear: They are not in support of nonmedical switching. Policies that directly influence patient health need to consider patient perspectives. Solutions to improve cost efficiency in health care exist but open, transparent collaboration between all involved stakeholders is required.

Abstract 332. Title: From Bioequivalence to Biosimilarity: The Rise of a Novel Regulatory Framework.
Publication Date: 2016-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25894088
Abstract: One of the most crucial issues in pharmacotherapy is to address the query if a patient can be switched from one product to another of the same active substance. For the conventional small-molecule drugs, there is a consensus on the required bioequivalence criteria. However, proving equivalence in the field of biologicals is an issue with no clear harmony. The aim of this review is to highlight the differences between the biologicals and the conventional chemical drugs, as well as, to present the different regulatory requirements for the placement of biosimilars on the market.Biologicals are substantially larger than chemical compounds, their manufacturing process is very complex, and their protein structure may trigger immune reactions. For this reason, the conventional bioequivalence approach is not adequate, but further emphasis should be placed on the quality of the manufacturing process and the risks of immunogenicity. The assessment procedure of biosimilars should encompass their comparison with the innovator product using all available evidence derived from the development process. The latter includes analytical and animal studies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, as well as, clinical trials focusing on immunogenicity. The US FDA has established a step-wise approach to demonstrate biosimilarity, while the EMA has already issued many guidelines referring either to all biosimilars or to specific products/classes. Overall, a case-by-case assessment procedure is considered by the regulatory authorities. In any case the placement of a biosimilar on the market does not necessarily imply interchangeability with the innovator drug.

Abstract 333. Title: Review of safety and efficacy of approved systemic psoriasis therapies.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246393
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which affects nearly 3% of the adult US population. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and need for long-term treatment, psoriasis is associated with substantial disease burden and negative impact on patients' quality of life. In the past, systemic agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin have been the mainstay treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. Multiple new molecular targets have been recently identified, and novel biologic therapies directed at these targets have been approved leading to a paradigm shift in psoriasis management. However, despite the availability of several treatment options and continued introduction of highly efficacious biologics, undertreatment of psoriasis patients remains a huge problem. This can be largely attributed to several causes including high cost of biologics, lack of experience, and reluctance of practitioners to initiate or switch to systemic treatment regimens in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. In this article, we aim to provide a concise review of mechanism, safety, and efficacy of the approved systemic treatments for psoriasis.

Abstract 334. Title: Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieving clinical remission (the IFX-SIRIUS study I): Study protocol for an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm and noninferiority clinical trial with clinical, ultrasound, and biomarker assessments.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-24
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32791688
Abstract: The introduction of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) into clinical practice has dramatically improve the clinical outcomes of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, bDMARDs are associated with high costs, which has resulted in restricted treatment access and a burden on medical insurance finances. Although biosimilars offer cost-saving, their effectiveness and safety must be established in Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS). Infliximab (IFX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, is the first bDMARD; its biosimilar, CT-P13, is the first biosimilar DMARD approved for RA treatment in Japan. We will evaluate whether switching from originator IFX to CT-P13 is not inferior for maintaining non-clinical relapse to continued treatment with originator IFX in RA patients achieving clinical remission.
This study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm against historical control and noninferiority clinical trial with a 24-week follow-up. Eighty RA patients who are treated by originator IFX for ≥24 weeks and are achieving clinical remission will be included. Patients will be switched to CT-P13 with the unchanged dosing regimen. We will evaluate disease activity by measuring clinical disease activity indices and by using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the ratio of patients who experience a nonclinical relapse during the study period. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from the baseline of the MSUS scores. We will also comprehensively analyze the serum levels of many biomarkers such as cytokines and chemokines.
The study results are expected to show the noninferiority of switching to CT-P13 over the continuation of originator IFX. The strength of this study is its prospective evaluation of therapeutic efficacy using not only clinical disease activity indices but also MSUS to accurately and objectively evaluate disease activity at the joint level among patients drawn from multiple centers with a standardized evaluation by MSUS. We will explore whether parameters at baseline can predict a nonclinical relapse after switching from originator IFX to CT-P13 by integrating multilateral assessments, i.e., clinical disease activity indices, MSUS findings, and serum biomarkers.

Abstract 335. Title: Are There Benefits and Risks to Biosimilars from a Patient Perspective?
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277756
Abstract: Biosimilars are copies of biologic medications, which no longer are protected by patent, that are intended to be marketed at lower prices than their reference products to increase patient access to treatment. Because a biosimilar must have equivalent pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity with its reference product, the only significant difference between the two should be cost. Lower-priced biosimilars are intended to introduce market competition. The availability of biosimilars should yield savings for the health care system and improve treatment outcomes by expanding patient access to effective medications. However, patients should partake of these cost savings.

Abstract 336. Title: Health Canada/BIOTECanada Summit on regulatory and clinical topics related to subsequent entry biologics (biosimilars), Ottawa, Canada, 14 May 2012.
Publication Date: 2012-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23084808
Abstract: In May 2012, Health Canada and other participants held a National Summit on Subsequent Entry Biologics (SEBs). Health Canada released a guidance document in March 2010 describing policy positions and data requirements for approval of SEBs. While Health Canada and health agencies in other regulatory jurisdictions are aligned on many scientific principles related to biosimilar drugs, Health Canada's specific requirements may not be widely understood by many Canadian stakeholders. The Summit provided an opportunity for education and dialog among physicians who prescribe biologics, provincial payers, and industry on the following topics: preclinical and clinical comparability studies; manufacturing and other product differences; extrapolation of indications; substitution and interchangeability of SEBs with reference biologic drugs in clinical practice; payers' current perspective; pharmacovigilance and naming. It is anticipated that the consensus reached at this meeting will further educate Canadian healthcare professionals, provincial payers, and insurers about the appropriate use of SEBs, and may be of general interest to others internationally.

Abstract 337. Title: Consensus-based recommendations for the use of biosimilars to treat rheumatological diseases.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28866648
Abstract: The study aimed to develop evidence-based recommendations regarding the evaluation and use of biosimilars to treat rheumatological diseases. The task force comprised an expert group of specialists in rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology, and pharmacologists, patients and a regulator from ten countries. Four key topics regarding biosimilars were identified through a process of discussion and consensus. Using a Delphi process, specific questions were then formulated to guide a systematic literature review. Relevant English-language publications through November 2016 were searched systematically for each topic using Medline; selected papers and pertinent reviews were examined for additional relevant references; and abstracts presented at the 2015 and 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual scientific meetings were searched for those about biosimilars. The experts used evidence obtained from these studies to develop a set of overarching principles and consensus recommendations. The level of evidence and grade of recommendation were determined for each. By the search strategy, 490 references were identified. Of these, 29 full-text papers were included in the systematic review. Additionally, 20 abstracts were retrieved from the ACR and EULAR conference abstract databases. Five overarching principles and eight consensus recommendations were generated, encompassing considerations regarding clinical trials, immunogenicity, extrapolation of indications, switching between bio-originators and biosimilars and among biosimilars, and cost. The level of evidence and grade of recommendation for each varied according to available published evidence. Five overarching principles and eight consensus recommendations regarding the evaluation and use of biosimilars to treat rheumatological diseases were developed using research-based evidence and expert opinion.

Abstract 338. Title: Descriptive Analysis of Long- and Intermediate-Acting Insulin and Key Safety Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31405345
Abstract: As new biosimilar and follow-on insulins enter the market, more data are needed on safety, effectiveness, and patterns of use for these products to inform prescriber and patient decision-making regarding treatment. Additionally, data are needed regarding real-world patterns of use to inform future studies comparing the safety and effectiveness of bio-similars to already approved agents for diabetes treatment.
To analyze the medication use patterns, adverse events, and availability of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) values for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who use long-acting insulin (LAI) or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), an intermediate-acting insulin.
We used the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's (BBCIC) distributed research network (DRN) for this descriptive analysis. The analysis time frame was January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015, and included patients continuously insured for at least 183 days before the first date of a filled prescription for LAI or NPH insulin alone or with rapid- or short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, whether newly starting insulin or switching to a different product. Insulin exposure episodes were the unit of analysis, and patients were classified in cohorts according to treatment. We followed patients until end of health plan enrollment or the end of the study period. We used occurrence of a study outcome, switch to another medication regimen, discontinuation of the current medication, or study end date to mark the end of an insulin episode. We describe demographics and availability of A1c values for analysis. Study outcomes included severe hypoglycemic events and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).
We identified 103,951 patients with T2DM from a database of 39.1 million patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage pharmacy and medical benefits, who contributed 279,533 unique insulin exposure episodes. Most episodes (89%) included patients using LAI, and 52% of patients contributed data to 2 or more exposure cohorts. Insulin episodes lasted an average of 3.5 months, and patients had an average follow-up of 8.6 months. The unadjusted rate of severe hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention was 96.9 per 10,000 patient-years at risk (10kPYR). The unadjusted incident MACE rate was 676.9 events per 10kPYR. 38,330 T2DM patients in the BBCIC DRN had a baseline A1c available, and of those, less than 50% had a follow-up A1c result.
Among patients with T2DM, our observed insulin patterns of use and rates of severe hypoglycemic outcomes and MACE are consistent with other studies. We noted a paucity of A1c results available, which implies that additional data sources may be needed to augment the BBCIC DRN.
This study was coordinated and funded by the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and represents the independent findings of the BBCIC Insulins Principal Investigator and the BBCIC Insulins Research Team.

Abstract 339. Title: Efficacy of pharmacological treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature research informing the 2019 update of the EULAR recommendations for management of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033937
Abstract: To inform the 2019 update of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
A systematic literature research (SLR) to investigate the efficacy of any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD, biological (b) and biosimilar DMARD, targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD) or glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in patients with RA was done by searching MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2016 and 8 March 2019.
234 abstracts were selected for detailed assessment, with 136 finally included. They comprised the efficacy of bDMARDs versus placebo or other bDMARDs, efficacy of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) across different patient populations and head-to-head of different bDMARDs versus JAKi or other bDMARDs. Switching of bDMARDs to other bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, strategic trials and tapering studies of bDMARDs, csDMARDs and JAKi were assessed. The drugs evaluated included abatacept, adalimumab, ABT-122, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, SBI-087, CNTO6785, decernotinib, etanercept, filgotinib, golimumab, GCs, GS-9876, guselkumab, hydroxychloroquine, infliximab, leflunomide, mavrilimumab, methotrexate, olokizumab, otilimab, peficitinib, rituximab, sarilumab, salazopyrine, secukinumab, sirukumab, tacrolimus, tocilizumab, tofacitinib, tregalizumab, upadacitinib, ustekinumab and vobarilizumab. The efficacy of many bDMARDs and tsDMARDs was shown. Switching to another tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or non-TNFi bDMARDs after TNFi treatment failure is efficacious. Tapering of DMARDs is possible in patients achieving long-standing stringent clinical remission; in patients with residual disease activity (including patients in LDA) the risk of flares is increased during the tapering. Biosimilars are non-inferior to their reference products.
This SLR informed the task force regarding the evidence base of various therapeutic regimen for the development of the update of EULAR's RA management recommendation.

Abstract 340. Title: [Current treatment of axial spondylarthritis : Clinical efficacy].
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31531695
Abstract: Drug treatment in patients with axial spondylarthritis (axSpA) aims to modify symptoms and complaints and currently includes the substance groups of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and biologicals (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, bDMARDS). Treatment with NSAIDs is the first line treatment according to international and national recommendations. Patients with persisting high disease activity despite continuous standard treatment with NSAIDs, should be treated with biologicals. In Germany treatment with tumor necosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or interleukin 17 inhibitor (secukinumab) are currently approved for treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Treatment of patients with non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) is restricted to TNF inhibitors (except infliximab) in Germany. The efficacy and safety are documented for both substance groups; however, due to the longer time since approval longitudinal data for TNF inhibitors are more robust and the data contain information about switching within a substance group. Although overall retention rates of TNF inhibitors are similar despite the difference in formation of antidrug antibodies, data from cohorts provide information about long-term loss of efficacy, switching and also discontinuation strategies. In the meantime, various biosimilars have been approved for infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab. Conventional basic treatment (csDMARDs) and in particular intra-articular administration of glucocorticoids can only be prescribed for axSpA patients with peripheral arthritis.

Abstract 341. Title: The Future of Biosimilars: Maximizing Benefits Across Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32002851
Abstract: Biologics have transformed the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Biosimilars-biologic medicines with no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy from licensed originators-can stimulate market competition and have the potential to expand patient access to biologics within the parameters of treatment recommendations. However, maximizing the benefits of biosimilars requires cooperation between multiple stakeholders. Regulators and developers should collaborate to ensure biosimilars reach patients rapidly without compromising stringent quality, safety, or efficacy standards. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations and payer policies should be updated following biosimilar market entry, minimizing the risk of imposing nonmedical barriers to biologic treatment. In RA, disparities between treatment guidelines and national reimbursement criteria could be addressed to ensure more uniform patient access to biologics and enable rheumatologists to effectively implement treat-to-target strategies. In IBD, the cost-effectiveness of biologic treatment earlier in the disease course is likely to improve when biosimilars are incorporated into pharmacoeconomic analyses. Patient understanding of biosimilars is crucial for treatment success and avoiding nocebo effects. Full understanding of biosimilars by physicians and carefully considered communication strategies can help support patients initiating or switching to biosimilars. Developers must operate efficiently to be sustainable, without undermining product quality, the reliability of the supply chain, or pharmacovigilance. Developers should also facilitate information sharing to meet the needs of other stakeholders. Such collaboration will help to ensure a sustainable future for both the biosimilar market and healthcare systems, supporting the availability of effective treatments for patients.

Abstract 342. Title: Retention Rate and Safety of Biosimilar CT-P13 in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Data from the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31734899
Abstract: The aim was to evaluate long-term drug retention, discontinuation, efficacy and safety of CT-P13 and reference infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) enrolled in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics (KOBIO) registry.
Patients included adults with RA who received CT-P13 or reference infliximab between December 2012 and December 2017. Drug retention, efficacy (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]-erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or DAS28-C-reactive protein [CRP] and American College of Rheumatology [ACR] core set measure), and adverse events (AEs) were assessed over 4-years' follow-up.
Data from 199 RA patients (CT-P13: n = 147; reference infliximab: n = 52) were analyzed. Median treatment duration was 1.22 years for CT-P13 and 1.40 years for reference infliximab (p = 0.67). Overall, 82% of patients received first-line therapy. Drug retention of CT-P13 versus reference infliximab was comparable for the overall population (p = 0.84) and for first-line (p = 0.66) and subsequent treatment lines (p = 0.96). Treatment changes or discontinuations occurred in 65.2% of patients with CT-P13 and 69.6% with reference infliximab. The most common reason for treatment changes or discontinuing treatment was lack of efficacy (CT-P13: 31.9%; reference infliximab: 34.8%). CT-P13 demonstrated comparable improvements in DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and ACR responses to reference infliximab. Overall, 19 grade 3 AEs were reported for CT-P13 and eight for reference infliximab.
Long-term data from patients with RA treated in routine clinical practice in Korea showed that CT-P13 had a comparable drug retention rate to reference infliximab, with similar efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. CLINICALTRIALS.

Abstract 343. Title: Real-world observational study of biosimilars in inflammatory arthritis treatment: a systematic literature review.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32808557
Abstract: The use of biological agents in patients with rheumatic diseases has achieved the therapeutic target, i.e., remission or low disease activity. The share of biological agents has been growing with the approval of biosimilars, which have been recognized for their equivalent efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity to the original as well as their reduced economic burden.
Biosimilars are being examined for their bioequivalence to reference products in randomized-controlled trials; however, the use of biosimilars in actual clinical practice is complicated owing to issues with switching and comorbidities. Therefore, this review describes real-world data in the rapidly evolving field of biosimilars in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathy, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.
According to published data, the use of biosimilars for inflammatory arthritis led to no significant inferiority in treatment outcomes and resulted in considerable cost savings in the real-world. Currently, beyond the use of biosimilars, issues with the interchangeability of biosimilars, including immunogenicity, should be addressed. Strategies to overcome these concerns will improve treatment efficacy and safety in patients with inflammatory arthritis.

Abstract 344. Title: A 5-year Retrospective Analysis of Drug Survival, Safety, and Effectiveness of the Infliximab Biosimilar CT-P13 in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32328979
Abstract: The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 has widely received regulatory approval in all indications of reference infliximab, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
This retrospective analysis investigated drug survival and long-term safety and effectiveness of CT-P13 in patients with RA or AS in the Republic of Korea.
This non-interventional, retrospective, multicenter analysis collected medical record data for adult patients with RA or AS who received CT-P13 treatment at five Korean referral hospitals (2012-2017). Drug survival and long-term safety were primary outcomes. The secondary outcome was long-term effectiveness, assessed by disease activity measures.
Overall, 491 patients were treated with CT-P13 (154 patients with RA [135 infliximab-naïve; 19 switched from reference infliximab]; 337 patients with AS [219 infliximab-naïve; 118 switched from reference infliximab]). Drug survival was similar in naïve and switched patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 31.8% and 29.4% of patients with RA and AS, respectively; incidence was similar in naïve and switched groups. Upper respiratory tract infection, influenza-like illness, and urticaria were the most common TEAEs. Overall, nine (1.8%) patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) deemed potentially drug-related; SAEs led to permanent CT-P13 discontinuation in five (1.0%) patients, including three with tuberculosis. Disease activity decreased over time.
Up to 5 years of CT-P13 treatment was safe and effective in patients with RA and AS, based on drug survival, incidence of TEAEs, and disease activity. Drug survival and safety were similar in naïve patients and switched groups, supporting switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13.

Abstract 345. Title: Looking to the future and learning lessons from the recent past: changing stakeholder perceptions of biosimilars in cancer.
Publication Date: 2017-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28482701
Abstract: As the patents for many biologic anticancer drugs expire, significant growth in the use of biosimilars is predicted, offering an opportunity to help combat the rising costs of treatment and increase patient access to biologic therapy. Attainment of regulatory approval, involving numerous nonclinical and clinical comparative studies versus each reference product, is only one of several barriers to realize the potential gains offered by biosimilars. It is important to understand the current perceptions and informational needs of different stakeholders if biosimilars are to be accepted and widely used in the clinic. We discuss these considerations and refer to recent experiences with CT-P13, a biosimilar of the TNF inhibitor infliximab used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.

Abstract 346. Title: The effect of extra-articular manifestations on tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor treatment duration in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: nationwide data from the Korean College of Rheumatology BIOlogics (KOBIO) registry.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30251059
Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor (TNFi) therapy has shown to be remarkably effective for treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS); however, nearly 30% of AS patients every year either stop TNFi therapy or switch to a different TNFi due to inefficacy or adverse effects. The goal of this study was to identify predictors of TNFi treatment duration, including extra-articular manifestations, using a nationwide registry in Korea. Data obtained from the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics (KOBIO) registry, a nationwide, multi-center database representing 58 tertiary care hospitals in Korea. Demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, disease activity indices (BASDAI, ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP), peripheral arthritis, and extra-articular manifestations (uveitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease) were studied in patients with AS during TNFi therapy. We also analyzed treatment duration outcomes for five TNFi agents (etanercept, infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, and golimumab), as well as factors associated with treatment duration, particularly in terms of extra-articular manifestations. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to verify preliminary results. A total 1482 AS patients starting TNFi drug therapy between Dec. 2012 and Jan. 2017 were included. No differences in demographics, disease activity, or extra-articular manifestations were evident between continued and discontinued TNFi groups at baseline, though baseline differences were detected for gender distribution, CRP, platelet counts, and HLA-B27 positivity. During treatment period, the effects of extra-articular manifestations, including uveitis (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 1.48, p = 0.74), enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, on TNFi treatment duration were not statistically significant. By contrast, the occurrence of peripheral arthritis was significantly associated with shorter TNFi treatment duration (unadjusted HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.95; adjusted HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.88). Among disease activity indices, higher ASDAS-ESR levels were significantly associated with shortening of the TNFi treatment duration (unadjusted HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.03; adjusted HR 2.23, 95% CI 2.00 to 2.63). Among TNFi drugs, golimumab had a lower discontinuation rate than that of etanercept over a 3-year follow-up period (unadjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.68; adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.99). In a nationwide KOBIO registry, extra-articular manifestations, including uveitis, were not associated with TNFi treatment duration. Among clinical cofactors, the development of peripheral arthritis during TNFi therapy was associated with a higher risk of TNFi treatment discontinuance in AS patients.

Abstract 348. Title: Biologic treatment sequences for plaque psoriasis: a cost-utility analysis based on 10 years of Dutch real-world evidence from BioCAPTURE.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29247500
Abstract: Treatment with biologics may be indicated for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, but comparative evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited. Switching of biologics is common, but it is unclear what the effect is of differences in sequences of biologics.
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different biologic treatment sequences for psoriasis based on real-world evidence.
A sequence model was developed to evaluate the costs and health effects of three consecutive lines of biologic treatments [for example adalimumab-etanercept-ustekinumab (Ada-Eta-Ust) vs. Eta-Ust-Ada] over a 10-year time horizon in the Netherlands. The model was populated with data from the Dutch BioCAPTURE registry and scientific literature. Analyses were conducted of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and uncertainty was addressed by probabilistic as well as scenario analyses.
Treatment of psoriasis with biologics for a 10-year period was estimated to be associated with a cost of €141 962 to €148 442 per patient depending on the treatment sequence used. Cumulative health effects ranged from 7·79 to 8·03 QALYs. Starting with Ada or Ust seems favourable concerning cost and utilities compared with strategies starting with Eta, although credible intervals were partly overlapping.
The order in which biologics are used influences treatment cost-effectiveness, both in terms of costs and health effects. Initiation of a biologic treatment sequence for psoriasis might best be done with Ada or Ust; Eta seems less optimal from a health-economic perspective.

Abstract 349. Title: [Evaluation of efficacy and comparative frequency of adverse events in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving the original infliximab and its biosimilar. One year of observation].
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32598753
Abstract: Real - life data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilar and biologic drugs licensed for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is lacking.
To investigate efficacy of original Infliximab (IFX) and its biosimilar in treating patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and determine the frequency of adverse events during 1 year follow - up period.
Our cohort consisted of 98 ulcerative colitis patients, treated with original IFX and its biosimilar since December 2017 till December 2018 years. Original Infliximab was prescribed in 56 UC patients (57.1%) during 5 years and longer; 16 patients (16.3%) were switched to IFX biosimilar; 13 UC bio - naïve patients (13.3%) received original IFX, 29 (29.6%) patients - biosimilar IFX. In 14 patients (14.3%) original infliximab was rotated with biosimilar. We picked out 42 patients to assess efficacy of original IFX and biosimilar.
Twelve patients, received original IFX and 28 patients, treated with its biosimilar, showed significant clinical improvement by decreasing Mayo index from 9.7±0.4 and 10.2±0.2 points to 1.9±0.09 and 2.1±0.1 points, accordingly. Also we noticed positive change in laboratory markers - CRP decrease from 89.6±8.7 mg/l and 77.5±8.0 mg/l to 6.5±0.8 mg/l and 6.9±0.8 mg/l (p>0.05), albumin increase from 30.1±4.7 g/l and 29.6±3.6 g/l to 34.1±6.3 g/l and 32.8±5.9 g/l (p>0.05), increase of serum iron levels from 6.4±0.5 mcg/l and 7.1±0.65 mcg/l to 14.6±4.4 mcg/l and 15.9±5.1 mcg/l (p>0.05), hemoglobin increase from 104.7±9.8 g/l and 102.2±8.8 g/l till 124±11.3 g/l and 121±10.9 g/l (p>0.05), and fecal calprotectin decrease from 1680±134 mcg/g and 1720±126 mcg/g till 245.5±33.4 mcg/g and 230.5±29.8 mcg/g (p>0.05). During 1 year follow - up 12 UC patients, treated with original IFX and its biosimilar, developed adverse events. The majority of adverse events (n=8) were registered in patients, rotating administration of original IFX and its biosimilar.
IFX biosimilar is effective as well as original IFX. Frequency of adverse events, occurred in patients, treated with original IFX, was comparable with adverse events frequency in patients, received biosimilar IFX. Frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in UC patients, rotating original IFX and its biosimilar.

Abstract 350. Title: Infliximab Biosimilar (Remsima™) in Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients: Experience from One Tertiary Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Centre.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28147356
Abstract: The evidence on the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (IFX) in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is sparse.
Consecutive IBD patients visiting our centre were included. One cohort composed of prospectively followed patients who were switched from original to biosimilar IFX between January and March 2015. The second cohort included retrospectively assessed anti-tumor necrosis factor α-naïve patients who started therapy between January 2015 and January 2016. Disease activity was assessed using standard clinical indices, endoscopic evaluation, and laboratory parameters (blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC)). Trough levels and anti-drug antibodies (ATIs) were also measured. Patients were evaluated 56 weeks (W56) after switch and at week 14 (W14) and week 46 (W46) in the naïve cohort.
Seventy-four IBD patients were switched to biosimilar IFX and 119 naïve patients newly initiated therapy with the preparation. Disease activity remained stable in a majority of switched patients (remission at week 0 (W0) vs. W56: 72.2 vs. 77.8%; median difference of both Harvey-Bradshaw index and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index between W0 and W56 was 0). When W0 and W56 were compared, no significant difference in CRP (4.3 ± 8.0 vs. 3.3 ± 3.8 mg/l; p = 0.89) and FC (135 ± 153 vs. 199 ± 225 µg/g; p = 0.17) was observed. In total, 92% of Crohn's disease (CD) and 83% of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responded to induction therapy (W14) with biosimilar IFX. At W46, the response rate was 86% in CD and 64% in UC. Moreover, half of UC patients experienced mucosal healing at W14 and improvement of perianal disease occurred in 95% of CD at W46. In this cohort, clear steroid-sparing effect was observed. No increase in immunogenicity was found in switched patients (ATI positivity: 9.5 vs. 6.0%, p = 0.54) and the type and frequency of adverse events were comparable to the original preparation in both cohorts.
Switching of IBD patients from original to biosimilar IFX is effective and safe.

Abstract 351. Title: Cardiac Safety of the Trastuzumab Biosimilar ABP 980 in Women with HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer in the Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled LILAC Study.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927716
Abstract: Although the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) blocker trastuzumab is generally well tolerated, cardiotoxicity can be an important therapeutic limitation.
In this prespecified analysis, we compared the cardiac safety of the trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 (KANJINTI™) and the trastuzumab reference product (RP; Herceptin<sup>®</sup>) in the phase III LILAC study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01901146).
In the neoadjuvant phase of LILAC, after run-in chemotherapy, 725 patients were randomized 1:1 to ABP 980 (n = 364) or trastuzumab RP (n = 361) plus paclitaxel (every 3 weeks [Q3W] or every week [QW]) for four cycles. After surgery, patients continued treatment Q3W for up to 1 year; ABP 980-treated patients continued ABP 980 (ABP 980/ABP 980; n = 364), and trastuzumab RP-treated patients either continued on the RP (trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP; n = 190) or switched to ABP 980 (trastuzumab RP/ABP 980; n = 171). Cardiac safety was monitored by computerized 12-lead electrocardiogram, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram. LVEF decline was defined as LVEF value decrease from study baseline by ≥ 10 percentage points and to < 50%.
Over the entire study, 22 (3.1%) patients had protocol-defined LVEF decline; no meaningful between-group differences were observed (ABP 980/ABP 980: 2.8%; trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP: 3.3%; trastuzumab RP/ABP 980: 3.5%). The incidence of cardiac adverse events was low and comparable in the treatment groups. One grade 3 cardiac failure event reported in the trastuzumab RP/ABP 980 arm, and another in the trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP arm, were coincident with LVEF decline. One patient discontinued the investigational product during the adjuvant phase because of cardiac failure.
These prespecified analyses confirm the tolerability of ABP 980 and demonstrate clinical similarity of ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP with respect to cardiac safety. No new cardiac safety signals were observed whether patients were receiving ABP 980 or switched from the RP to ABP 980.

Abstract 352. Title: Totality of Scientific Evidence in the Development of ABP 980, a Biosimilar to Trastuzumab.
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31620980
Abstract: ABP 980 was developed as a biosimilar to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), that is indicated for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer (EBC), and metastatic gastric cancer. ABP 980 is approved in the United States, European Union, and Japan for all the indications of trastuzumab, based on the totality of evidence (TOE) gathered by the systematic step-wise accumulation of comparative analytical, preclinical, and clinical (pharmacokinetics [PK], efficacy, safety and immunogenicity) data for ABP 980 and trastuzumab reference product (RP). As a key first step of the ABP 980 biosimilar program, comprehensive analytical characterization of critical quality attributes established that ABP 980 is structurally and functionally similar to trastuzumab RP. Complementing these data, results of non-clinical pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies supported similarity between ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP. A randomized study in healthy subjects demonstrated clinical PK equivalence of ABP 980 relative to trastuzumab RP in these subjects. In the final clinical evaluation step, a randomized comparative study (LILAC) confirmed the lack of clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP in efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in women with HER2-positive EBC in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting. Neoadjuvant EBC represented a sensitive homogenous population for biosimilar demonstrations, and the primary endpoint of pathologic complete response served as a sensitive surrogate endpoint. An important aspect of the LILAC study design is that it is the only study that evaluated the effect of switching from the trastuzumab RP to a trastuzumab biosimilar during the adjuvant phase. No new or unexpected safety signals emerged in the clinical evaluations, with the safety profile of ABP 980 consistent with that previously described for trastuzumab. Overall, the TOE data generated for ABP 980 support the conclusion that it is highly similar to trastuzumab RP, thus providing the scientific justification for extrapolation to all the approved indications of trastuzumab.

Abstract 353. Title: Totality of Evidence Supporting the Use of ABP 980, a Trastuzumab Biosimilar: Practical Considerations.
Publication Date: 2021-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33428085
Abstract: ABP 980 (KANJINTI™, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA; Amgen Europe B.V., The Netherlands) is a biosimilar to trastuzumab (Herceptin<sup>®</sup>), a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Here we provide a brief overview of the totality of evidence (including analytical [structural and functional] characterization, nonclinical evaluation, and human pharmacokinetic [PK], pharmacodynamic, and clinical assessment comparing ABP 980 with trastuzumab reference product [RP]) that supported the approval of ABP 980, along with practical considerations on the reconstitution and use of the lyophilized product to ensure safe and effective administration. ABP 980 has been shown to be highly similar to the RP, with similar mechanism of action, binding, and potency. Key PK parameters, geometric means ratio (GMR [90% CI]) of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>inf,</sub> are comparable and within the equivalence margin of 0.80 to 1.25 (ABP 980: 1.04 [0.99-1.08] versus trastuzumab US: 1.06 [1.00-1.12]; ABP 980: 0.99 [0.95-1.03] versus trastuzumab EU: 1.00 [0.95-1.06]). No clinically meaningful differences were found between ABP 980 and RP in a comparative clinical trial in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Pathological complete response-ABP 980: 48% versus RP: 41% (risk difference [RD], 90% CI: 7.3%, 1.2-13.4; relative risk [RR], 90% CI: 1.188, 1.033-1.366). Sensitivity analyses per central pathology review-ABP 980: 48%; RP: 42% (RD: 5.8%, -0.5 to 12.0; RR: 1.142, 0.993-1.312), with RD and RR falling within predefined equivalence margins. Similar to trastuzumab RP, KANJINTI™ is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized cake to be reconstituted with bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) for multiple-dose injection or sterile WFI for single use. Stability data support storage of reconstituted solution at 2-8°C (36-46°F), up to 28 days. Reconstituted solution can be diluted in infusion bags containing 0.9% saline and stored for up to 24 h prior to intravenous administration.

Abstract 354. Title: Systematic review with meta-analysis: the efficacy and safety of CT-P13, a biosimilar of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α agent (infliximab), in inflammatory bowel diseases.
Publication Date: 2017-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28239873
Abstract: Biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents have now become clinically available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilars of anti-TNF-α agents in patients with IBD.
Electronic databases were searched. The outcomes were the pooled rates of clinical response or remission, sustained clinical response or remission, and adverse events in patients with IBD induced with or switched to biosimilars of anti-TNF-α agents.
Eleven observational studies reporting outcomes in 829 patients treated with biosimilar of infliximab (CT-P13) were identified. The pooled rates of clinical response among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) at 8-14 weeks were 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.88) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65-0.82), respectively, and at 24-30 weeks were 0.77 (95% CI = 0.63-0.86) and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.67-0.85) respectively. Adverse events were rare (CD, 0.08 (95% CI = 0.02-0.26); UC, 0.08 (95% CI = 0.03-0.17)). The pooled rates of sustained clinical response among CD and UC after switching from infliximab to CT-P13 at 30-32 weeks were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.71-0.93) and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.58-1.00), respectively, and at 48-63 weeks were 0.75 (95% CI = 0.44-0.92) and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.19-0.99) respectively. Adverse events were rare (CD, 0.10, 95% CI = 0.02-0.31; UC, 0.22, 95% CI = 0.04-0.63).
CT-P13 was associated with excellent clinical efficacy and safety profile, supporting its use in the treatment of IBD.

Abstract 355. Title: The biosimilars journey: current status and ongoing challenges.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30302115
Abstract: Biosimilar products are already approved and marketed in several countries. The Food and Drug Administration has approved ten different biosimilars, and the European Medicines Agency has approved 40. Even though this scenario has provided important experience with biosimilar products, there are still challenges and unanswered questions. Up to now, a good amount of knowledge has been gathered in order to support the importance of the totality of evidence and the construction of a biosimilarity exercise for regulatory approval. In addition, the extrapolation of indications has been proved viable when a careful analysis is performed. The models for clinical trials and the use of the most sensible populations have been extensively discussed, and there is apparent homogeneity in manufacturer choices for study designs. However, some challenges remain. The lack of regulatory harmony, especially concerning naming, the marketed intended copies, the interchangeability, and the biosimilars in orphan diseases are some of those and are the focus of discussion in this review.

This cost-of-illness study was conducted to identify direct, indirect and out-of-pocket costs of treating patients with IBD in Serbia. Patients with IBD (n = 112) completed a semi-structured questionnaire with data concerning their utilisation of heath-care resources and illness-related expenditures. All costs were calculated in Republic of Serbia dinars (RSD) at a 1-year level (2014) and subsequently converted to Euros. Median values and ranges were reported to avoid potential distortions associated with mean costs.
Median total direct costs and total indirect costs per patient per year in patients with Crohn's disease were 192,614.32RSD (€1602.97) and 28,014.00RSD (€233.13) and 142,267.15RSD (€1183.97) and 21,436.00RSD (€178.39), respectively, in patients with ulcerative colitis. In both groups, the greatest component of direct costs was hospitalisation.
Costs of IBD in Serbia are lower than in more developed countries for two reasons. These include the fact that expensive biological therapy is currently under-utilised in Serbia and prices of health services are largely controlled by the State at a low level. The under-utilisation of biologicals may change with the advent of biosimilars at increasingly lower prices.

Abstract 357. Title: Who is afraid of biosimilars? Openness to biosimilars in an Australian cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141205
Abstract: Biosimilars are increasingly adopted to improve affordability of biologics. An effective introduction of biosimilars requires an understanding of patient acceptance of these agents. We performed a cross-sectional study of 132 patients with rheumatoid arthritis prior to the introduction of biosimilar switching or prescribing in this cohort. Despite being unfamiliar with biosimilars, most patients are willing to accept biosimilar medicines if recommended by their rheumatologist. Patient concerns about biosimilar uptake mainly focus on concerns about its efficacy. There is a significant correlation between patient attitudes towards biosimilar and generic medicines.

Abstract 358. Title: PANLAR consensus statement on biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2019-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915652
Abstract: Biologics have improved the treatment of rheumatic diseases, resulting in better outcomes. However, their high cost limits access for many patients in both North America and Latin America. Following patent expiration for biologicals, the availability of biosimilars, which typically are less expensive due to lower development costs, provides additional treatment options for patients with rheumatic diseases. The availability of biosimilars in North American and Latin American countries is evolving, with differing regulations and clinical indications.
The objective of the study was to present the consensus statement on biosimilars in rheumatology developed by Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR).
Using a modified Delphi process approach, the following topics were addressed: regulation, efficacy and safety, extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, automatic substitution, pharmacovigilance, risk management, naming, traceability, registries, economic aspects, and biomimics. Consensus was achieved when there was agreement among 80% or more of the panel members. Three Delphi rounds were conducted to reach consensus. Questionnaires were sent electronically to panel members and comments about each question were solicited.
Eight recommendations were formulated regarding regulation, pharmacovigilance, risk management, naming, traceability, registries, economic aspects, and biomimics.
The recommendations highlighted that, after receiving regulatory approval, pharmacovigilance is a fundamental strategy to ensure safety of all medications. Registries should be employed to monitor use of biosimilars and to identify potential adverse effects. The price of biosimilars should be significantly lower than that of reference products to enhance patient access. Biomimics are not biosimilars and, if they are to be marketed, they must first be evaluated and approved according to established regulatory pathways for novel biopharmaceuticals.
• Biologics have improved the treatment of rheumatic diseases. • Their high cost limits access for many patients in both North America and Latin America. • Biosimilars typically are less expensive, providing additional treatment options for patients with rheumatic diseases. • PANLAR presents its consensus on biosimilars in rheumatology.

Abstract 359. Title: [Biosimilars].
Publication Date: 2011-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22045529
Abstract: Biosimilars are biological medicinal products referring to an existing biological originator product and submitted to regulatory authorities formarketing authorization by an independent applicant after the patent has expired. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued overarching and specific guidelines that should be fulfilled in order to receive approval as biosimilar. In accordance with these guidelines biosimilars of recombinant somatropin, epoetin alfa, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor have gained market authorisation in the EU. Similarity in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to a reference product was demonstrated. Points to consider when switching from the innovator product to a biosimilar, or from one biosimilar to another, are reported. INN-naming, labelling, pharmacovigilance issues, interchangeability, and substitution of biosimilars are still a matter of discussion.

Abstract 360. Title: [Practical aspects in the use of biosimilar insulins].
Publication Date: 2016-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27750344
Abstract: Following the market authorization of the first insulin biosimilar in 2014, further approvals are to be expected due to patent expiry of several originator insulins. Knowledge of the manufacturing and the characteristics of these pharmaceutical products is important for their rationale and safe use by the physician, the pharmacist and the patient.Biosimilars are not generics, but similar or comparable, yet not identical versions of the originator biopharmaceutical. Marketing authorization in the EU is granted only after passing a stringent procedure. So far, there is no evidence of problems specifically associated with insulin biosimilars. However, shifting a patient from an originator insulin to a biosimilar (or vice versa) should be done with care and under close monitoring. Automatic substitution of biosimilars in the pharmacy is not permitted in Germany. Administration devices also have a significant impact on safe use.

Abstract 361. Title: Nocebos in rheumatology: emerging concepts and their implications for clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361674
Abstract: Nocebo effects are noxious reactions to therapeutic interventions that occur because of negative expectations of the patient. In the past decade, neurobiological data have revealed specific neural pathways induced by nocebos (that is, interventions that cause nocebo effects), as well as the associated mechanisms and predisposing factors of nocebo effects. Epidemiological data suggest that nocebos can have a notable effect on medication adherence, clinical outcomes and health-care policy. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) indicate that withdrawal of treatment by placebo-arm participants owing to adverse events is common; a proportion of these events could be nocebo effects. Moreover, in large-scale, open-label studies of patients with RMDs who transition from bio-originator to biosimilar therapeutics, biosimilar retention rates were much lower than in previous double-blind switch RCTs. This discrepancy suggests that in addition to the lack of response in some patients because of intrinsic differences between the drugs, nocebos might have an important role in low biosimilar retention, thus increasing the need for awareness and early identification of nocebo effects by rheumatologists and allied health-care professionals.

Abstract 362. Title: Non-pharmacological Effects in Switching Medication: The Nocebo Effect in Switching from Originator to Biosimilar Agent.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30269270
Abstract: The nocebo effect is defined as the incitement or the worsening of symptoms induced by any negative attitude from non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention, sham, or active therapies. When a patient anticipates a negative effect associated with an intervention, medication or change in medication, they may then experience either an increase in this effect or experience it de novo. Although less is known about the nocebo effect compared with the placebo effect, widespread interest in the nocebo effect observed with statin therapy and a literature review highlighting the nocebo effect across at least ten different disease areas strongly suggests this is a common phenomenon. This effect has also recently been shown to play a role when introducing a medication or changing an established medication, for example, when switching patients from a reference biologic to a biosimilar. Given the important role biosimilars play in providing cost-effective alternatives to reference biologics, increasing physician treatment options and patient access to effective biologic treatment, it is important that we understand this phenomenon and aim to reduce this effect when possible. In this paper, we propose three key strategies to help mitigate the nocebo effect in clinical practice when switching patients from reference biologic to biosimilar: positive framing, increasing patient and healthcare professionals' understanding of biosimilars and utilising a managed switching programme.

Abstract 363. Title: Pharmacists' considerations on non-medical switching at the hospital: a systematic review of the economic outcomes of cost-saving therapeutic drug classes.
Publication Date: 2021-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472819
Abstract: Non-medical switching (NMS) strategies have the capacity to reduce overall costs in hospitals while maintaining a high level of care. However, the most appropriate diseases and/or medicines for NMS strategies are still vague. The aim of this review was to give a state-of-the-art summary regarding the economic outcomes resulting from the use of NMS strategies and to discuss whether they would be implementable in a hospital inpatient setting.
A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and ScienceDirect. Studies published between 1988 and 2018 were included if they evaluated the economic impact of NMS strategies or if they performed an economic evaluation between two drugs. Studies regarding antineoplastic agents, endocrine therapies, and immunostimulants, or immunosuppressants, and biosimilars were excluded.
Fifty (69%) studies assessing an NMS strategy and 22 (31%) studies comparing two medicines were allocated to four categories: prospective studies (n=8, 11%); retrospective chart reviews (n=29, 40%); retrospective claims analysis (n=13, 18%); and retrospective data analysis (n=22, 31%). Hypercholesterolemia, peptic ulcer, and gastro-oesophageal reflux diseases, diabetes mellitus, and venous thromboembolism were the most prevalent diseases in studies evaluating an NMS strategy. Sixty-eight per cent of the included papers reported a reduction in costs with no significant changes in health outcomes and 8 per cent reported a deterioration in health outcomes and/or increased costs.
Regardless of the exclusion of studies regarding biologics or medicines used in oncology, the review highlights that NMS strategies with medicines whose management do not require a thorough clinical assessment were associated with reduced costs and no significant changes in patients' health outcomes, in the inpatient setting. NMS strategies targeting medicines that require an extensive clinical assessment should be evaluated using hospital-specific effectiveness and/or utility data prior to their implementation.

Abstract 364. Title: Compatibility of immunogenicity guidance by the EMA and the US FDA.
Publication Date: 2019-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30672313
Abstract: The guidelines for immunogenicity studies by the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA are based on different legislations and regulatory philosophies. In spite of the different background, the main guidelines are compatible on the scientific level, especially for new innovative therapeutic protein products. The importance of sensitive and drug-tolerant antidrug antibody assays and multidisciplinary approach to development and assessment are highlighted by both agencies. The main differences are in the field of biosimilars. The nonclinical <i>in vivo</i> immunogenicity studies are seen more useful by the FDA than by the European Medicines Agency. The draft FDA guidance on interchangeability will complicate global biosimilar development by requiring clinical switch studies with US sourced reference product.

Abstract 365. Title: Biosimilar regulation in the EU.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26294076
Abstract: In the EU, the EMA has been working with biosimilars since 1998. This experience is crystallized in the extensive set of guidelines, which range from basic principles to details of clinical trials. While the guidance may appear complicated, it has enabled the development of biosimilars, of which 21 have managed to get marketing authorization. Currently marketed biosimilars in the EU have a good track record in safety and traceability. No biosimilars have been withdrawn from the market because of safety concerns. The most controversial issues with biosimilars are immunogenicity and extrapolation of therapeutic indications. The available data for these topics do not raise concerns among EU regulators. Interchangeability and substitution are regulated by individual EU member states.

Abstract 366. Title: Interchangeability of Biosimilars: A European Perspective.
Publication Date: 2017-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28120313
Abstract: Many of the best-selling 'blockbuster' biological medicinal products are, or will soon be, facing competition from similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) in the EU. Biosimilarity is based on the comparability concept, which has been used successfully for several decades to ensure close similarity of a biological product before and after a manufacturing change. Over the last 10 years, experience with biosimilars has shown that even complex biotechnology-derived proteins can be copied successfully. Most best-selling biologicals are used for chronic treatment. This has triggered intensive discussion on the interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference product, with the main concern being immunogenicity. We explore the theoretical basis of the presumed risks of switching between a biosimilar and its reference product and the available data on switches. Our conclusion is that a switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is unlikely and very difficult to substantiate that two products, comparable on a population level, would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients upon a switch. Our conclusion is that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable.

Abstract 367. Title: Progress with infliximab biosimilars for inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688797
Abstract: Biological therapies have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in the last two decades. Though biological drugs are effective, their use is associated with high costs and access to biological agents varies among countries. As the patent for the reference products expired, the advent of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies has been expected. Biosimilars represent less expensive alternatives compared to the reference product.
In this review, authors will review the literature on the clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of current and future biosimilar infliximabs. Short- and medium-term data from real-life cohorts and from randomized-clinical trials in IBD demonstrated similar outcomes in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity as the reference product for CT-P13. Switch data from the reference to the biosimilar product are also accumulating (including the NOR-SWITCH and the CT-P13 3.4 study).
The use of biosimilar infliximab in IBD is increasing worldwide. Its use may be associated with budget savings leading to better access to biological therapies and consequently improved health outcomes. Switching from the originator to a biosimilar in patients with IBD is acceptable, although scientific and clinical evidence is lacking regarding reverse switching, multiple switching, and cross-switching among biosimilars in IBD patients.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29781758
Abstract: To give an overview of the pharmaceutical policy in the largest medical center in Morocco, a developing country in socio-economic transition.
This is an analytical descriptive study of the drug formulary and the purchasing process carried out at the Ibn Sina University Medical Center.
Our formulary included 830 drugs belonging to 14 classes according to the Anatomical, Therapeutic and Chemical (ATC) Classification System. There was a respective predominance of class N (21.8%), class B (13.5%), and class J (12.6%). Injectable route was dominant (46%). Drugs had a significant actual benefit in 70% (according to the French Data), reimbursable in 42.8%, essential in 29.2% according to World Health Organization (WHO) list, and in 36.9% according to the Moroccan list. The calls for tenders included 542 drugs representing 65% of the formulary, and the attribution rate was 71%. The main reason for non-attribution was the lack of offers. Generics accounted for 45% by volume and 26.5% by value.
With this first study, we were able to identify key indicators on drugs used in the largest medical center in Morocco. The current challenge is to introduce pharmacoeconomics in decision making concerning the updates of the drug formulary.

Abstract 369. Title: Generics and substitution modalities: proposed methods for the evaluation of equivalence, traceability and pharmacovigilance reporting.
Publication Date: 2008-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18937910
Abstract: The use of generics results in savings for the budget of the health insurance, and no player of health could question seriously the principle. The generic drug of a reference medicinal product defines itself as a drug having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients, the same dosage form and the bioequivalence with this reference medicinal product was demonstrated by appropriate studies of bioavailability. It is the right to switch granted to the pharmacists in 1999 that is at the origin of the real development of these specialties on the French pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, about 10 years later, it seems that the system in place does not offer all the necessary securities with regard to pharmacovigilance, notably for the products with narrow therapeutic margin. By strengthening and/or by completing the role played by the health care professionals and the public institutions concerned, it is highly possible to improve the robustness of the system. Also, the recent arrival in Europe of the biosimilars, similar molecules but not bioequivalent to biological products, cause an even more tricky specific situation than that of the generics because of their nature, of the difficulty to manufacture them, and of the risk of immunogenicity. If the substitution is not permitted in several European countries including France, the other issues can appear especially in case of interchangeability requiring also, the reinforcement of certain measures.The various aspects are described in this article with concrete proposals on how the current system can be made safer, both for the generics and the biosimilars.

Abstract 370. Title: SB2: An Infliximab Biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28803431
Abstract: SB2 is a biosimilar of the reference anti-TNF-α antibody infliximab. In May 2015, it was approved in the EU for use in all indications for which reference infliximab is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. It is also approved in these indications in several other countries, including Korea, the USA and Australia. Characterization of SB2 in preclinical studies showed that it is similar to reference infliximab. SB2 demonstrated pharmacokinetic biosimilarity to reference infliximab in healthy volunteers, and clinically equivalent efficacy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. SB2 was generally well tolerated; the safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar to those of reference infliximab with no additional safety concerns identified. Switching from reference infliximab to SB2 did not impact clinical efficacy, safety or immunogenicity. The role of reference infliximab in the management of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is well established, and SB2 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring infliximab therapy.

Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524079
Abstract: A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that is highly similar to an already authorized original biological medicinal product. The introduction of biosimilars may allow for a reduction in health care costs, due to discount pricing. Current clinical studies and real-world data suggest that the biosimilar SB4 is equivalent to etanercept with respect to efficacy and safety. Additional real-world safety data for SB4 via pharmacovigilance studies are needed to draw conclusions regarding the risks of rare adverse events such as serious infections and malignancy. Clinical trial design of biosimilars should be standardised to improve consistency, increase confidence and facilitate interpretation of data. Where there are health economic advantages of switching from originator to biosimilar, patients should be appropriately informed, and, ideally, in order to minimise nocebo responses and maximise benefit, switching should be undertaken by shared decision-making between the physician and patient on a case-by-case basis.

Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428415
Abstract: No study has evaluated the direct annual costs of inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy.
The purpose of this study was to identify annual direct costs and main cost drivers of anti-tumour necrosis factor-treated inflammatory bowel disease patients.
All inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with infliximab or adalimumab at Nancy University Hospital were consecutively screened for inclusion from November 2016-February 2017. Data about hospitalisation, surgery, medication, outpatient visits, investigations and transport over the previous 12 months were retrospectively collected.
A total of 108 patients (<i>n</i> = 83 Crohn's disease; <i>n</i> = 25 ulcerative colitis) were included. The mean annual cost per patient was €15,775 (standard deviation €7221), with no difference between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (<i>p</i> = 0.2). The main cost driver was medication, which accounted for 84% of the total direct cost. Hospitalisation and surgery represented 11% and 2% of the direct costs. History of switch to another anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment was identified as the only independent predictor of greater direct costs in the multivariate analysis (<i>p</i> = 0.0018).
In a French tertiary referral centre, direct costs of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy-treated patients were mainly driven by medication, while hospitalisation and surgery represented only a minor part of the costs. There was no difference between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients.

Abstract 373. Title: [Biosimilar medicines: Regulatory issues and medico-economic impacts].
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32836292
Abstract: The concept of biosimilar medicine was launched by 2001 and 2004 European Directives. First European marketing authorizations were delivered in 2006. They are "copies" of biologically manufactured medicines, mostly proteins. Taking into account the intrinsic variability related to the biological manufacture process, some variation of the chemical structure of the finished compound may be observed. They impact especially the glycosylation residues but not the amino-acid sequence (for proteins). For this reason, the marketing authorization application dossier has to involve, as opposed to the generic medicine procedure, the demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence in at least one clinical indication of the princeps medicine. Introduction of biosimilar medicines of monoclonal antibodies has represented a remarkable event in the domain of rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology with infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab biosimilars and in cancerology domains with rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab biosimilars. Biosimilar medicines availability reduces the risk of drug supply rupture of princeps but their main impact is the economic one allowing cost reduction of costly princeps biological medicines. With the acquired clinical experience, the initial fears concerning switch form princeps to a biosimilar for a given patient has progressively disappeared.

Abstract: PF-06410293 (Amsparity<sup>™</sup>/Abrilada<sup>™</sup>) is a biosimilar of the anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibody adalimumab. It is approved for use in all indications for which adalimumab is approved, including inflammatory joint diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), uveitis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. PF-06410293 has similar physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of EU- and US-sourced reference adalimumab, and the pharmacokinetic similarity of the agents is supported. PF-06410293 demonstrated therapeutic equivalence to EU-sourced reference adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and was generally well tolerated in this population. The tolerability, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles of PF-06410293 were similar to those of EU-sourced reference adalimumab, and switching from reference adalimumab to PF-06410293 appeared to have no impact on safety or efficacy. The role of adalimumab in the management of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is well established and PF-06410293 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring adalimumab therapy.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290739
Abstract: We evaluated real-world effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 (Truxima<sup>®</sup>) compared with originator rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment. Before and after the introduction of CT-P10 to our institute (November 2017), 221 newly-diagnosed DLBCL patients received rituximab with standard cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone. Patients received originator rituximab throughout (<i>n</i> = 95), switched from originator rituximab to CT-P10 (<i>n</i> = 36), or received CT-P10 throughout (<i>n</i> = 90). There were no significant differences between groups in overall response rate (91.6% vs 94.4% vs 96.7%, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.403) or complete response rate (84.2% vs 77.8% vs 86.7%, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.467). Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed no significant differences in progression-free survival and overall survival between groups (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.794 and <i>p</i> = 0.955, respectively). Safety profiles were comparable between treatment groups. These data support the ability of CT-P10 to successfully replace originator rituximab in DLBCL treatment and, given the lowered financial barrier, to improve the overall prognosis for DLBCL patients.

Abstract 376. Title: Post-Marketing Pooled Safety Analysis for CT-P13 Treatment of Patients with Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases in Observational Cohort Studies.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32356239
Abstract: At EU marketing authorisation, safety data for CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) were limited, particularly in some indications, and uncommon adverse events (AEs) could not be evaluated among relatively small analysis populations.
Our objective was to investigate the overall safety profile and incidence rate of AEs of special interest (AESIs), including serious infections and tuberculosis, in CT-P13-treated patients.
Data were pooled from six observational studies representing authorised indications of CT-P13 (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, adult and paediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Patients were analysed by indication and treatment (patients who received CT-P13 or those who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13 ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment or during the study).
Overall, 4393 patients were included (n = 3677 CT-P13 group; n = 716 switched group); 64.03% of patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 6.31% of patients were antidrug antibody positive. Overall, 32.94% and 9.58% of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs, respectively. Across indications, TEAEs were more frequent with CT-P13 than with the switched group. Infections including tuberculosis were the most frequent serious AESI overall (2.48%) and by treatment group or indication. In total, 14 patients (0.32%) reported active tuberculosis. Overall incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) were 3.40 (2.788-4.096) for serious infections including tuberculosis and 0.44 (0.238-0.732) for active tuberculosis. Infusion-related reactions were the second most frequent AESI following infection including tuberculosis.
The CT-P13 safety profile appears consistent with previous studies for CT-P13 and reference infliximab, supporting the favourable risk/benefit balance for CT-P13 treatment.

Abstract 377. Title: Budget Impact of Switching to Biosimilar Trastuzumab (CT-P6) for the Treatment of Breast Cancer and Gastric Cancer in 28 European Countries.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31201616
Abstract: As the economic burden of treating cancer patients has been soaring in European countries, performing a budget impact analysis is becoming one of the requirements for payers' application dossiers.
The objective of this study was to estimate the budgetary impact of introducing the biosimilar trastuzumab (CT-P6) from the payer's perspective and to determine the number of additional patients who could be treated with resulting savings in 28 European countries.
A budget impact model was developed to analyze the financial impact of switching from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in the treatment of early and metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer with a time horizon of 1-5 years. Budgetary savings and the number of patients potentially affected were measured based on epidemiological and sales volume data. The base-case analysis assumed that the price of CT-P6 is 70% of the originator price, the switching rate of originator to CT-P6 in the first year is 20%, and the annual growth in the switching rate for each subsequent year is 5%.
For analyses using the base-case scenario following CT-P6 introduction, the total estimated budgetary savings over a 5-year period (depending on the scenario) ranged from €1.13 billion to €2.27 billion based on epidemiological data, or from €0.91 billion to €1.82 billion based on sales volume data. In the first year only, the projected budgetary savings ranged from €58 million to €136 million, and the number of additional patients who could be treated using the savings ranged from 3503 to 7078 by sensitivity analysis.
The conducted budget impact analysis assessing a switch from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in 28 European countries indicates that budget savings could be between €0.91 billion and €2.27 billion over the next 5 years. These savings could be used to help improve patient access to local biologics in their respective countries while simultaneously strengthening the overall public health landscape across the European Union.

Abstract 378. Title: Pharmacist Substitution of Biological Products: Issues and Considerations.
Publication Date: 2015-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26108377
Abstract: Biosimilars are biological products that are highly similar to their biological reference products, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. However, unlike generics of small-molecule drugs, biosimilars are not identical to their reference products, since each manufacturer uses unique cell lines and processes, and these lead to slight structural differences between products. Because these structural variations can lead to differences in clinical response, clinical studies demonstrating biosimilarity are required before and robust pharmacovigilance after approval. Although the FDA has not yet issued formal guidance on interchangeable biosimilars, higher standards of similarity will be required in order to achieve an interchangeable designation. In this commentary, we review the differences between generics and biosimilars, describe their respective regulatory approval pathways, discuss interchangeability and substitution, and review substitution of interchangeable biosimilars, focusing on key professional considerations for pharmacists.

Abstract 379. Title: Full dose, half dose, or discontinuation of etanercept biosimilar in early axial spondyloarthritis patients: a real-world study in China.
Publication Date: 2019-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31110537
Abstract: To investigate the effect of dose maintenance, reduction, or discontinuation of the etanercept biosimilar Yisaipu (YSP) on early axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients in remission with YSP 50 mg once weekly (QW).
Patients were enrolled in three groups: full dose (YSP50), half dose (YSP25), and discontinuation (YSP0). Patients were assessed by the same rheumatologist every 8 weeks for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of non-failure patients in each group. If a flare occurred during the study period, the patient resumed YSP 50 mg QW or was switched to another tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.
A total of 144 patients were included and each group included 48 patients. The proportion of non-failure patients was significantly greater in the YSP50 group than in the YSP0 group at 48 weeks (91.7% vs. 72.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.032). The difference in the other two comparisons was not statistically significant (YSP50 vs. YSP25 group, <i>p</i> = 0.522; YSP25 vs. YSP0 group, <i>p</i> = 0.132). The median time to flare did not differ significantly between the three groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Most patients who flared regained remission rapidly after resuming YSP 50 mg QW or starting adalimumab 40 mg every other week.
For patients with early axSpA in remission on YSP for more than 12 weeks, continuation of YSP at full dose was superior to discontinuation of YSP, but not superior to halving the dose.

Abstract 380. Title: Switching biologics used in inflammatory bowel diseases: how to deal with in practice?
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166871
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease patients do not all respond to biological treatment since several patients will initially respond but will lose response or develop side effects over time. In such cases, a switch from one biologic to another offers a valuable clinical solution. This requires to evaluate both patient and drug profiles in combination with the reason(s) for switching in order to adequately select the second-line biologic. Therapeutic drug monitoring is obviously a useful tool but is currently limited to the use of anti-TNFα. In this review paper, we provide overview and guidance on switching biologics in clinical practice, with the emphasis on the motivations for switching, the selection of the second-line biologic, as well as explanations on how and when to switch.

Abstract 381. Title: Economic Impact of Non-Medical Switching from Originator Biologics to Biosimilars: A Systematic Literature Review.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31168766
Abstract: A systematic literature review was conducted to review and summarize the economic impact of non-medical switching (NMS) from biologic originators to their biosimilars (i.e., switching a patient's medication for reasons irrelevant to the patient's health).
English publications reporting healthcare resource utilization (HRU) or costs associated with biosimilar NMS were searched in PubMed and EMBASE over the past 10 years and from selected scientific conferences over the past 3 years, along with gray literature for all biologics with an approved biosimilar (e.g., tumor-necrosis factor inhibitors, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, insulin and hormone therapies).
A total of 1311 publications were retrieved, where 54 studies met the selection criteria. Seventeen studies reported increased real-world HRU or costs related to biosimilar NMS, e.g., higher rates of surgery (11%), steroid use (13%) and biosimilar dose escalating (6-35.4%). Among the studies that the estimated cost impact associated with NMS, 33 reported drug costs reduction, 12 reported healthcare costs post-NMS without a detailed breakdown, and 5 reported NMS setup and managing costs. Cost estimation/simulation studies demonstrated the cost reduction associated with NMS. However, variation across studies was substantial because of heterogeneity in study designs and assumptions (e.g., disease areas, scenarios of drug price discount rates, cost components, population size, study period, etc.).
Real-world studies reporting the economic impact of biosimilar NMS separately from drug costs are emerging, and those that reported such results found increased HRU in patients with biosimilar NMS. Studies of cost estimation have been largely limited to drug prices. Comprehensive evaluation of the economic impact of NMS should incorporate all important elements of healthcare service needs such as drug price, biologic rebates, HRU, NMS program setup, administration and monitoring costs.

Abstract 382. Title: Comprehensive manipulation of glycosylation profiles across development scales.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30252592
Abstract: The extent and pattern of glycosylation on therapeutic antibodies can influence their circulatory half-life, engagement of effector functions, and immunogenicity, with direct consequences to efficacy and patient safety. Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.

Abstract 383. Title: How much are biosimilars used in southern Italy?: a retrospective analysis of epoetin utilization in the local health unit of Messina in the years 2010-2011.
Publication Date: 2012-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22385406
Abstract: Epoetins are one of the three biologics for which biosimilars are available in Italy. So far, there is a lack of Italian national/regional longitudinal data about epoetin use.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prescribing pattern of epoetins (reference products and biosimilars) in a Local Health Unit (LHU) of Southern Italy in recent years.
A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted during the period 1 January 2010 - 31 May 2011. The data source was the dispensing database of the Messina LHU, which contains anonymized data about dispensed drugs (including epoetins) that are prescribed by specialists to the residents in the catchment area. Indication of use and prescribed dosage of epoetins were derived by the therapeutic plans filled in by specialists and linked to drug dispensing records. Prevalence of epoetin use in the province of Messina (653 810 inhabitants) in 2010 was calculated. Furthermore, frequency analyses by sex, age, indication of use of epoetin users, as well as measurement of volume of use (defined daily dose [DDD]/1000/day) and expenditure of epoetins in 2010 were also performed. Analysis of the switching pattern between different reference products and biosimilar epoetins was performed.
Overall, 4288 patients were treated with epoetins during the study period (mean age  ± SD: 74.2 ± 13.7; females: 52%). Darbepoetin alpha and reference product epoetin alpha accounted overall for 79.8% of epoetin users, while biosimilars of epoetin alpha accounted for 0.9%. Among 1247 epoetin users for whom the therapeutic plan was revised, 1065 (85.4%) were treated because of anemia due to chronic kidney disease and 158 (12.6%) because of chemotherapy-induced anemia. In 2010, prevalence of epoetin use was 5.5 (95% CI 5.3, 5.7) per 1000 inhabitants in the province of Messina. The volume of use and related expenditure for epoetins was 3.58 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day and Euro 5 572 457 (about Euro 8.50 per capita/day) in 2010. Switching between different epoetins was very frequent (21.8% of users) but switching from reference products to biosimilars was very rare.
Epoetins are frequently dispensed to residents in the province of Messina, mainly for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related anemia, with a relevant impact on the pharmaceutical expenditure covered by the National Health System. Use of biosimilar products is very low in both naïve patients and in those who switch from other reference product epoetins.

Abstract 384. Title: Safety and efficacy of switching from infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 to infliximab biosimilar SB2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33369956
Abstract: For patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, switching from infliximab originator to biosimilars is effective and safe. Few data on single switch have been published, and data on multiple switches of different infliximab are unavailable.
A retrospective analysis of patients who switched from CT-P13 to SB2, and of those with multiple switches among different infliximab compounds was conducted. Clinical activity, C reactive protein (CRP), adverse events (AE) and loss of response (LOR) were recorded.
Thirty-six patients (26 males, 14 Crohn's disease and 22 ulcerative colitis) were enrolled and followed up for >6 months. All patients switched from CT-P13 to SB2; 12 of them (33.3%) had already switched from reference Infliximab to CT-P13, and for the remaining patients CT-P13 was the first infliximab. The clinical remission rate six months before and three months after SB2-switch was the same (58.3%) and the rate of mild activity varied from 27.8 to 33.3% (P = 0.68); the percentage of patients with normal CRP values passed from 94.4 to 91.7% (P = 1). Two patients (5.5%) had AE and 11 (30.5%) a LOR. At univariate analysis, patients with a single switch had a non-significant risk of LOR during SB2 [odds ratio (OR) = 7.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-71, P = 0.06]. SB2-LOR was associated with previous AE under CT-P13 (OR = 9.1, 95% CI 0.82-100, P = 0.07). None of such factors was significant at multivariate analysis.
Switching from CT-P13 to SB2 seems to be safe and effective either in patients with a single than in those with multiple switches.

Abstract 385. Title: Maneuvering Clinical Pathways for Crohn's Disease.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-23
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31016466
Abstract: Crohn's disease management has changed significantly with increasing use of biologics. We review the recent literature on the clinical management of Crohn's disease and new approaches in selecting and optimizing therapy.
Recent studies have addressed the efficacy of proactive anti-TNFα trough level monitoring, the efficacy of biosimilars, and the efficacy and immunogenicity of newer biologics including anti-integrin therapy and anti-IL12/23 therapy. Optimizing anti-TNFα therapy according to trough concentrations correlates with improved remission rates. Patients can be switched from the reference drug to a biosimilar, or vice versa, without a measurable change in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity. Immunomodulators are effective in decreasing immunogenicity and boosting anti-TNFα drug level. The anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23 therapies are effective as induction and maintenance therapy with low immunogenicity and excellent safety profiles. Patients at high risk for post-operative recurrence should be started on a biologic therapy within 4 weeks post-op. Multiple biologic therapies are currently available for treatment of Crohn's disease including anti-TNFα therapy, anti-integrin therapy, and anti-IL12/23 therapy. The choice of first-line therapy should be based on individual risk-benefit analysis, route of administration, and patient preference. Patient with inadequate response should have their trough level checked and therapy optimized. Therapeutic prophylaxis for post-operative recurrence should be based on patient's risk factors for recurrence.

Abstract 386. Title: [Biosimilars in oncology: a therapeutic alternative to the reference products?].
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723912
Abstract: Biosimilar medicinal products (biosimilars) have been available in Europe for 10 years, allowing a wide use particularly in oncology. Biosimilars are being developed and approved by means of scientifically sound principles to assure close similarity with the reference products with regard to quality, efficacy, and safety. The scientific principles for establishing biosimilarity are the same as those for demonstrating comparability after a change in the manufacturing process of an already licensed biological. Nevertheless, many clinicians voiced concerns about biosimilars related to their pharmaceutical quality, efficacy (particularly in extrapolated indications), safety (especially immunogenicity), and interchangeability with the originator product. The availability of biosimilars would strengthen the economic competition on the pharmaceutical market, provide opportunities to improve healthcare access, and contribute to the financial sustainability of European healthcare systems. Biosimilars can be considered therapeutic alternatives to the reference product. To date, no data has been published revealing any disadvantages of the biosimilars' use. This article aims to acquaint clinicians, particularly oncologists and haematologists, with the biosimilar concept as they are going to be confronted with a constantly increasing number of biosimilars due to patent expirations in the near future. Furthermore, it provides information on scientific principles guiding biosimilar development and regulatory requirements. This should minimise unfounded fears and concerns among clinicians. Additionally, we provide information on the interchangeability between originator products and biosimilars to assist clinicians in making evidence-based, appropriate, and cost-effective treatment choices for their patients.

Abstract 387. Title: Switching From Originator Adalimumab to the Biosimilar SB5 in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Short-term Experience From a Single Tertiary Clinical Centre.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-30
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905382
Abstract: Patients' perspectives after switching from originator to biosimilar adalimumab have yet to be assessed. We evaluated the efficacy of switching from the originator adalimumab to a biosimilar compound [SB5] in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD].
Data on IBD patients who were switched from the originator to biosimilar adalimumab [SB5] at IBD Center ISCARE were analysed. Disease activity was assessed using standard clinical indices (Harvey-Bradshaw index [HBI] for Crohn's disease [CD] and partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis [UC]), and laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP] and faecal calprotectin [FC]). Trough levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured. Patients were evaluated 10 weeks [W10] after the switch, and results were compared with the control group of patients on originator compound.
A total of 93 patients switched to biosimilar adalimumab were included [CD 86%] and were matched to 93 controls for age, gender, diagnosis, and disease activity. There was no difference in the disease activity in either SWITCH or ORIGINATOR cohorts between Weeks 0 and 10. Similarly, no difference was found between cohorts at both prespecified time points. Moreover, no significant differences in CRP or FC concentrations were seen between W0 and W10 either in the SWITCH, or in the ORIGINATOR cohort [p >0.05]. Adalimumab serum trough levels remained stable after the switch. No new safety signals were detected.
Our study confirmed that switching IBD patients from the originator adalimumab to a biosimilar compound [SB5] does not affect treatment efficacy.

Abstract 388. Title: Real-World Patient Experience of Switching Biologic Treatment in Inflammatory Arthritis and Ulcerative Colitis - A Systematic Literature Review.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32109997
Abstract: To obtain an up-to-date overview of the measurement of patient experience of switching biologic treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Secondary objectives included summarizing the types of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) used (if any), and related findings; and summarizing medical and non-medical reasons for treatment switch and/or discontinuation.
A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed, searching Medline and Embase for relevant publications.
In total, 70 relevant publications were identified. While the majority of these reported reasons for switching and/or discontinuing treatment, only four provided information explicitly regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment. All four utilized ranking tools to assess patient experience of switching biologic treatment. The most common reason for switching and/or discontinuing treatment was loss of efficacy, while the least common reason was patient preference.
Although the number of available treatments in IA and UC have increased, there is a sparsity of information regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment. Further research regarding patient preference and/or experience would benefit this therapeutic area and help guide treatment choices.

Switching radiometal from <sup>68</sup>Ga to <sup>111</sup>In impaired tumor targeting in mice, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized <sup>111</sup>In-SB3 in circulation and remarkably increased tumor uptake. We herein report on the biological profile of <sup>111</sup>In-SB4: <sup>111</sup>In-[dAla<sup>11</sup>]SB3. <i>Methods</i>: The biological responses of <sup>111</sup>In-SB3/SB4 were compared in PC-3 cells and animal models. <i>Results</i>: Gly<sup>11</sup>/dAla<sup>11</sup>-replacement deteriorated GRPR-affinity (SB4 IC<sub>50</sub>: 10.7 ± 0.9 nM vs. SB3 IC<sub>50</sub>: 4.6 ± 0.3 nM) and uptake in PC-3 cells (<sup>111</sup>In-SB4: 1.3 ± 0.4% vs. <sup>111</sup>In-SB3 16.2 ± 0.8% at 1 h). <sup>111</sup>In-SB4 was more stable than <sup>111</sup>In-SB3, but PA-coinjection stabilized both radiotracers in peripheral mice blood. Unmodified <sup>111</sup>In-SB3 showed higher uptake in PC-3 xenografts (8.8 ± 3.0%ID/g) vs. <sup>111</sup>In-SB4 (3.1 ± 1.1%ID/g) at 4 h pi. PA-coinjection improved tumor uptake, with <sup>111</sup>In-SB3 still showing superior tumor targeting (38.3 ± 7.9%ID/g vs. 7.4 ± 0.3%ID/g for <sup>111</sup>In-SB4). <i>Conclusions</i>: Replacement of Gly<sup>11</sup> by dAla<sup>11</sup> improved in vivo stability, however, at the cost of GRPR-affinity and cell uptake, eventually translating into inferior tumor uptake of <sup>111</sup>In-SB4 vs. unmodified <sup>111</sup>In-SB3. On the other hand, in-situ NEP-inhibition turned out to be a more efficient and direct strategy to optimize the in vivo profile of <sup>111</sup>In-SB3, and potentially other peptide radiotracers.

Abstract 391. Title: The SPOSIB SB2 Sicilian Cohort: Safety and Effectiveness of Infliximab Biosimilar SB2 in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Including Multiple Switches.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-19
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32083291
Abstract: No data on the recently introduced infliximab (IFX) biosimilar SB2 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are available.
The Sicilian Prospective Observational Study of Patients With IBD Treated With Infliximab Biosimilar SB2 is a multicenter, observational, prospective study performed among the cohort of the Sicilian Network for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. All consecutive IBD patients starting the IFX biosimilar SB2 from its introduction in Sicily (March 2018) to September 2019 (18 months) were enrolled.
Two hundred seventy-six patients (Crohn disease: 49.3%, ulcerative colitis: 50.7%) were included: 127 (46.0%) were naïve to IFX and naïve to anti-tumor necrosis factor medications (anti-TNFs), 65 (23.5%) were naïve to IFX and previously exposed to anti-TNFs, 17 (6.2%) were switched from an IFX originator to SB2, 43 (15.6%) were switched from the biosimilar CT-P13 to SB2, and 24 (8.7%) were multiply switched (from IFX originator to CT-P13 to SB2). The cumulative number of infusions of SB2 was 1798, and the total follow-up time was 182.7 patient-years. Sixty-seven serious adverse events occurred in 57 patients (20.7%; incidence rate: 36.7 per 100 patient-year), and 31 of these events caused the withdrawal of the drug. The effectiveness after 8 weeks of treatment was evaluated in patients naïve to IFX (n = 192): 110 patients (57.3%) had steroid-free remission, while 56 patients had no response (29.2%). At the end of follow-up, 72 patients (26.1%) interrupted the treatment, without significant differences in treatment persistency estimations between the five groups (log-rank P = 0.15).
The safety and effectiveness of SB2 seem to be overall similar to those reported for the IFX originator and CT-P13.

Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961747
Abstract: Biosimilar monoclonal antibodies are being developed globally for patients with different types of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Applications for proposed biosimilar monoclonal antibodies are being submitted to the regulatory authorities around the world and may increase patient access to key treatment options upon approval. An understanding among stakeholders (e.g., physicians, patients and their caregivers, pharmacists, payers) of the approval criteria, as well as the similarities and differences in regulatory pathways involved in biosimilar approval in different countries, as presented in this review, will facilitate identification of high-quality, safe, monoclonal antibodies that have been developed according to strict, biosimilar regulatory standards. Further guidance and resolution of the ongoing discussions on biosimilar labeling, naming, automatic substitution, and indication extrapolation may ensure, in the future, an effective and appropriate use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies by oncologists and other stakeholders in daily clinical practice.

Abstract 393. Title: Can We Extrapolate Data from One Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disease to Another One?
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30381062
Abstract: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases share several pathogenic pathways and this pushes sometimes to extrapolate from one disease or indication to others. A biosimilar can be defined as a biotherapeutic product which is similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to an already licensed reference biotherapeutic product. We review the substrate for extrapolation, the current approval process for biosimilars and the pioneering studies on biosimilars performed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. A biosimilar has the same amino acid sequence as its innovator product. However, post-translational modifications can occur and the current analytical techniques do not allow the final structure. To test the efficacy in one indication, a homogeneous population should be chosen and immunogenicity features are essential in switching and interchangeability. CT-P13 (Remsima™; Inflectra™) is a biosimilar of reference infliximab (Remicade®). It meets most of the requirements for extrapolation. Nevertheless, in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) we need more studies to confirm the postulates of extrapolation from rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis to IBD. Furthermore, an effective pharmacovigilance schedule is mandatory to look for immunogenicity and side effects.

Abstract 394. Title: The performance of Remicade®-optimized quantification assays in the assessment of Flixabi® levels.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30263065
Abstract: The advent of Remicade® biosimilars, Remsima®, Inflectra® and, more recently, Flixabi®, has brought along the potential to decrease the costs associated with this therapy, therefore increasing its access to a larger group of patients. However, and in order to assure a soft transition, one must make sure the assays and algorithms previously developed and optimized for Remicade perform equally well with its biosimilars. This study aimed to: (a) validate the utilization of Remicade-optimized therapeutic drug monitoring assays for the quantification of Flixabi; and (b) determine the existence of Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi cross-immunogenicity.
Healthy donors' sera spiked with Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were quantified using three different Remicade-quantification assays, and the reactivity of anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera to Remicade and to its biosimilars was assessed.
The results show that all tested Remicade-infliximab-optimized assays measure Flixabi as accurately as they measure Remicade and Remsima: the intraclass correlation coefficients between theoretical and measured concentrations varied from 0.920 to 0.990. Moreover, the interassay agreement values for the same compounds were high (intraclass correlation coefficients varied from 0.936 to 0.995). Finally, the anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera reacted to the different drugs in a similar fashion.
The tested assays can be used to monitor Flixabi levels. Moreover, Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were shown to have a high cross-immunogenicity, which supports their high similarity but prevents their switching in nonresponders with antidrug antibodies.

Abstract 395. Title: Continuation of Anti-TNF in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Remission Is Not Cost-effective Compared With Treatment Withdrawal: A Markov Model.
Publication Date: 2021-May-04
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33125060
Abstract: Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNF] treatment accounts for 31% of health care expenditures associated with ulcerative colitis [UC]. Withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients with UC in remission may decrease side effects and infections, while promoting cost containment. Approximately 36% of patients relapse within 12-24 months of anti-TNF withdrawal, but reintroduction of treatment is successful in 80% of patients. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of continuation versus withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients with UC in remission.
We developed a Markov model comparing cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF continuation versus withdrawal, from a health care provider perspective. Transition probabilities were calculated from literature, or estimated by an expert panel of 11 gastroenterologists. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for assumptions and uncertainty. The cost-effectiveness threshold was set at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €80,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY].
At 5 years, anti-TNF withdrawal was less costly [-€10,781 per patient], but also slightly less effective [-0.04 QALY per patient] than continued treatment. Continuation of anti-TNF compared with withdrawal costs €300,390/QALY, exceeding the cost-effectiveness threshold. Continued therapy would become cost-effective if the relapse rate following anti-TNF withdrawal was ≥43% higher, or if adalimumab or infliximab [biosimilar] prices fell below €87/40 mg and €66/100 mg, respectively.
Continuation of anti-TNF in UC patients in remission is not cost-effective compared with withdrawal. A stop-and-reintroduction strategy is cost-saving but is slightly less effective than continued therapy. This strategy could be improved by identifying patients at increased risk of relapse.

Abstract 396. Title: How did the Introduction of Biosimilar Filgrastim Influence the Prescribing Pattern of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factors? Results from a Multicentre, Population-Based Study, from Five Italian Centres in the Years 2009-2014.
Publication Date: 2016-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27138636
Abstract: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) are biological products for which the main indication of use is chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Biosimilars of G-CSFs have been available in Europe since 2007.
The objective of this study was to investigate the prescribing pattern of G-CSFs in five Italian centres using different healthcare policy interventions to promote the use of biosimilars in routine care.
This retrospective, population-based drug utilization study was conducted during the years 2009-2014 using the administrative databases of the Caserta, Treviso and Palermo Local Health Units (LHUs) and the Tuscany and Umbria regions. G-CSF users were characterized and the prevalence of use, proportion of biosimilar users and switching pattern of different G-CSFs were evaluated over time and across centres.
Overall, 30,247 patients were treated with G-CSFs in the years 2009-2014, of which 29,083 (96.2 %) were naïve users. The overall prevalence of G-CSF use increased from 0.8 per 1000 inhabitants in 2009 to 1.1 per 1000 in 2014. An increase in the proportion of the use of the biosimilar filgrastim by the total G-CSF users was observed in all centres: from 0.2 % (2009) to 66.2 % (2014). However, heterogeneity across different centres was reported, with the largest increase in Treviso LHU (from 0 to 89.1 % from 2009 to 2014). During the first year of treatment, switching between different G-CSFs was frequent (20.3 %).
Heterogeneity in the use of G-CSF and, in particular, biosimilar filgrastim across different Italian centres was observed, probably due to different regional healthcare policy interventions. During the first year of treatment, switching between different G-CSFs was frequent. Considering the impact of biological drugs on pharmaceutical expenses, it is necessary to harmonize healthcare policies promoting the use of biological drugs with the lowest cost.

Abstract 397. Title: Real-world use of biological drugs in patients with psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis: a retrospective, population-based study of years 2010-2014 from Southern Italy.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29582617
Abstract: Biological drugs, such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, golimumab and certolizumab are third-line therapy for psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), but they may be used at earlier stage in severe forms. This study investigated the pattern of use and costs of biological drugs for PsO/PsA in a large population from Southern Italy during the years 2010-2014.
This was a retrospective, population-based, drug-utilization study, using healthcare administrative databases of the ASL (Local Health Unit) and two hospitals of Messina Province (Sicily) in the years 2010-2014. Incident users of adalimumab, ustekinumab, infliximab, etanercept and golimumab for PsO/PsA were characterized. Yearly prevalence of use and costs, as well as time to treatment discontinuation and switch were assessed.
During the study period, 517 patients received at least one study drugs prescription for PsO/PsA and 304 (58.8%) were incident users, mostly treated with adalimumab (33.6%). Incident users were mostly males (59.8%), with a median age of 49 years. The prevalence of biological drugs users in PsO/PsA increased from 4.3 to 6.9 per 10,000 inhabitants from 2011 to 2014. Pharmaceutical expenditure of the study drugs almost doubled (from 2.6 to 4.7 million euros over 5 years of observation). During the first year of treatment, discontinuation occurred in 31.8% of incident users and switch was not infrequent (7.4%).
Prevalence of use and costs of biological drugs for PsO/PsA substantially increased in recent years in a large population of Southern Italy. Larger uptake of lowest cost biological drugs, and biosimilars whenever available, may help access to the most innovative drugs.

Abstract 398. Title: Human parainfluenza virus fusion complex glycoproteins imaged in action on authentic viral surfaces.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956394
Abstract: Infection by human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) causes widespread lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, and there are no vaccines or effective treatments for these viruses. HPIV3 is a member of the Respirovirus species of the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with genomes composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. During viral entry, the first step of infection, the viral fusion complex, comprised of the receptor-binding glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), mediates fusion upon receptor binding. The HPIV3 transmembrane protein HN, like the receptor-binding proteins of other related viruses that enter host cells using membrane fusion, binds to a receptor molecule on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers the F glycoprotein to undergo major conformational rearrangements, promoting viral entry. Subsequent fusion of the viral and host membranes allows delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The intermediate states in viral entry are transient and thermodynamically unstable, making it impossible to understand these transitions using standard methods, yet understanding these transition states is important for expanding our knowledge of the viral entry process. In this study, we use cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to dissect the stepwise process by which the receptor-binding protein triggers F-mediated fusion, when forming a complex with receptor-bearing membranes. Using an on-grid antibody capture method that facilitates examination of fresh, biologically active strains of virus directly from supernatant fluids and a series of biological tools that permit the capture of intermediate states in the fusion process, we visualize the series of events that occur when a pristine, authentic viral particle interacts with target receptors and proceeds from the viral entry steps of receptor engagement to membrane fusion.

Abstract 399. Title: A Review of the Totality of Evidence Supporting the Development of the First Adalimumab Biosimilar ABP 501.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31183781
Abstract: ABP 501 [United States: AMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto); European Union: AMGEVITA<sup>®</sup> (adalimumab)] is the first approved biosimilar to adalimumab [reference product (RP)], a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α). ABP 501 has received approval for use in indications that adalimumab RP is approved for, except those protected by regulatory exclusivity. A systematic step-wise totality of evidence (TOE) approach formed the basis of approval of ABP 501; this involved methodical accumulation of scientifically robust comparative data supporting similarity in analytical, preclinical, and clinical [pharmacokinetics (PK)], efficacy, safety and immunogenicity) evaluations. As a foundational first step, comprehensive analytical assessments demonstrated that ABP 501 is structurally and functionally similar to adalimumab RP in critical quality attributes. Preclinical assessments confirmed similar activity in assessing mechanisms of action and toxicology. Clinical evaluation included a phase 1 PK equivalence study in healthy subjects and two comparative phase 3 studies that evaluated ABP 501 and adalimumab RP in two sensitive patient populations, plaque psoriasis (PsO) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The PK profiles of ABP 501 and adalimumab RP were similar in healthy subjects as well as patients with PsO and RA. The pivotal phase 3 study in patients with PsO demonstrated that ABP 501 was clinically similar to adalimumab RP in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in both the primary and transition phases. The pivotal phase 3 study in patients with RA also established clinical similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab RP; an open-label extension of this study demonstrated sustained efficacy over an additional 72 weeks, with no new safety or immunogenicity concerns with ABP 501 treatment. Overall, the TOE supported the conclusion that ABP 501 is highly similar to adalimumab RP and provided scientific justification for extrapolation to all the approved indications of adalimumab RP not protected by exclusivities.Funding: Amgen Inc.

Abstract 400. Title: Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27758715
Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, because of their complexity, their production is expensive contributing to their high price. As the patent protection of these therapies has expired in several countries, biosimilars have been developed to reduce the healthcare costs. The aim of this article is to review the literature on the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of biosimilars in IBD.
A PubMed literature search was performed using the following terms until May 2016: 'biosimilars', 'CT-P13', 'infliximab', 'Crohn's disease', 'ulcerative colitis', 'inflammatory bowel diseases', 'efficacy', 'safety', 'immunogenicity'. Additionally, abstracts from international meetings were also reviewed.
A total of eleven studies in IBD patients provided real-world evidence on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profile of biosimilars in IBD patients. Based on the available evidence, CT-P13 is efficacious and well tolerated in IBD patients in a real-life setting. The vast majority of studies only included IBD patients who had never received biological therapies. Information regarding the interchangeability between CT-P13 and its originator is currently being investigated in the NOR-SWITCH trial. Otherwise, the immunogenicity profile of CT-P13 seems to be similar to the originator.
The infliximab biosimilar seems to be efficacious, safe and with a similar immunogenicity profile as the originator in IBD. Large prospective post-marketing studies are needed to assess the long-term safety profile of CT-P13. The use of infliximab biosimilars may lead to major healthcare cost savings.

Abstract 401. Title: Long-term effectiveness and pharmacokinetics of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 after switching from the originator during the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2022-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33115797
Abstract: Switching patients from the originator infliximab to a biosimilar is a measure to expand access to treatments and counteract its negative impact on healthcare budgets. However, industry-independent long-term studies on the effect of switching in real life to support the lack of switch-related problems in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are sparse, as are studies addressing infliximab pharmacokinetic behaviour. The objectives were to investigate the effectiveness and the pharmacokinetics of CT-P13 after switching from originator infliximab in a real-world population of IBD patients with a follow-up of 2 years.
Prospective, single-centre, observational 2 year study conducted in IBD adult patients with stable disease treated with the originator infliximab who were switched to CT-P13. Four time points were defined for follow-up: prior to the switch, 4-8 weeks after the switch, 8 months later, and 2 years later. Outcome measures were the proportion of patients with clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission, and changes in biochemical inflammation markers (albumin, C-reactive protein, faecal calprotectin) and infliximab clearance.
42 IBD patients were switched, of which 36 (85.7%) remained on CT-P13 throughout the 2 year study period. Only two patients discontinued CT-P13 due to loss of response. The proportion of patients who displayed clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission were unchanged during the follow-up (p&lt;0.05) and no statistically significant changes were observed in the biochemical markers of disease activity. The median (IQR) clearance estimated for the infliximab originator before the change was 0.364 (0.321-0.415) L/day, and for the CT-P13 biosimilar it was 0.361 (0.323-0.415) L/day 4-8 weeks after the change, and 0.370 (0.334-0.419) L/day 2 years after (p=0.395).
Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 did not affect the long-term clinical outcomes or the pharmacokinetic behaviour. This information provides the clinician more evidence for the success of switching and supports non-medical switching in adult IBD patients.

Abstract 402. Title: Infliximab concentrations in two non-switching cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: originator vs. biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-13
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33051546
Abstract: Biosimilars are replacing originator compounds due to their similar effectiveness, safety and pharmacokinetics. Our objective was to compare the differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes between the originator infliximab (Ifx) and the biosimilar CT-P13 in a patient cohort with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our cohort study included 86 patients from a historical and a prospective cohort from the start of infliximab treatment to 22 weeks later. Serum infliximab, antidrug antibody levels and other serum biomarkers were measured at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22. Remission outcomes were evaluated at weeks 14 and 22. Drug levels were measured prospectively and analysed using MANOVA. Of the 86 patients, 44 (51%) and 42 (49%) were administered the originator and CT-P13, respectively. Originator trough levels were higher than the biosimilar trough levels (35 vs. 21, 20.1 vs. 11, 6.6 vs. 2.9 and 4.3 vs. 1.7 μg/mL at weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22, respectively). A post-hoc analysis demonstrated changes in mean serum drug levels over time (p < 0.001) and according to the drug employed (p = 0.001). At week 22, 13 (81%) patients administered the originator achieved clinical remission compared with 5 (19%) patients with the biosimilar (p = 0.02). None of the patients administered the originator withdrew from the treatment compared with 7 for the biosimilar. During the study, there were significant differences in serum infliximab levels between the originator and the CT-P13 in the patients with IBD. The clinical outcomes were influenced by the type of compound administered.

Abstract 403. Title: A single nucleotide substitution in the internal ribosome entry site of foot-and-mouth disease virus leads to enhanced cap-independent translation in vivo.
Publication Date: 1993-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8389904
Abstract: Mutants of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) with altered biological properties can be selected during the course of persistent infection of BHK-21 cells with FMDV C-S8c1 (J. C. de la Torre, E. Martínez-Salas, J. Díez, A. Villaverde, F. Gebauer, E. Rocha, M. Dávila, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 62:2050-2058, 1988). Two nucleotide substitutions, U to C at position -376 and A to G at position -15, (counting as +1 the A of the first functional AUG), were fixed within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of R100, the virus rescued after 100 passages of the carrier BHK-21 cells. IRES-directed cap-independent protein synthesis was quantitated by using bicistronic constructs of the form chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene-IRES-luciferase gene. The IRES from R100 was 1.5- to 5-fold more active than that of C-S8c1 in directing cap-independent luciferase synthesis. This enhanced translational activity was observed when the RNAs were transcribed either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm by a weak or a strong promoter, respectively. C-S8c1 and R100 IRES elements were functional in both FMDV-sensitive and FMDV-resistant cells (including persistently infected R cells), indicating that factors mediating cap-independent protein synthesis are not limited in any of the analyzed cell lines. Constructs in which each of the two mutations in the R100 IRES were analyzed separately indicate that the transition at position -376 is responsible for the enhanced activity of the R100 IRES. By estimating the effect that an increase in the initial translation efficiency may have on subsequent RNA replication steps, we suggest that the modifications in the IRES elements can account for the previously described hypervirulence of FMDV R100 for BHK-21 cells. The results show that a single point mutation in an IRES element of a picornavirus can cause an increase in translation efficiency.

Abstract 404. Title: [Biosimilars, the journey has begun].
Publication Date: 2015-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25817091
Abstract: According to the European Medicine Agency, a "biosimilar" is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an original biological medicinal product (reference or innovative medicinal product) that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference medicinal product by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable to a wide range of chemically derived medicinal products, is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological medicinal product with due regard to its brand name and batch number. The situation of the European Community and the regulatory framework have been developed since the first applications (growth hormone), almost a decade ago, until the recent advent (monoclonal antibodies). The introduction to the market of biosimilars have positive effects on competition by improving access to biological therapies.

Abstract 405. Title: Efficacies of first and second tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in refractory ulcerative colitis patients in real-world practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33106991
Abstract: Switching tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors is an important treatment option for refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who fail the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, although many questions about this option remain unanswered.
The efficacy of the second anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in refractory UC patients who failed the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy was examined using the Mayo score as a measure of disease activity at week 8. The efficacy of the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy before treatment and at weeks 8 and 52 was also evaluated in real-world practice.
There were no significant differences in remission induction and maintenance between infliximab and adalimumab as the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in UC patients. Of 123 UC patients, 21 (17.1%) switched tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Eight (38.1%), 4 (19.0%), 7 (33.3%), and 2 (9.5%) patients switched from infliximab to adalimumab, infliximab to golimumab, adalimumab to infliximab, and adalimumab to golimumab, respectively. Three (100%) with intolerance to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, 5 (41.7%) with loss of response to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, and 1 (20.0%) with no improvement with the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy had clinical remission at week 8.
Switching tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors is more effective for refractory UC patients who are intolerant and lose response to the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy rather than for those showing no improvement with the first anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy. Patients with primary failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy should be switched to another class of drug.

Abstract: <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to demonstrate the equivalence of NI-071, an infliximab biosimilar (BS), and the infliximab reference product (RP) for treating Japanese patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to methotrexate.<b>Methods:</b> In this multicenter two-period phase III study, patients were treated with BS or RP for 30 weeks (Period I) in a randomized double-blind manner and then with BS for the following 24 weeks (Period II). The efficacy and safety of BS and RP were compared.<b>Results:</b> The disease activity score in 28-joint count based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein and the American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70-based efficacy profiles of BS were similar to those of RP during Period I (30 weeks) including evaluations at week 14, a critical time point. BS efficacy was maintained throughout the 54-week study period. BS efficacy profile matched the RP profile until week 54 after the drug switch from RP to BS at week 30. The safety profiles of BS and RP were comparable and the long-term safety of BS was confirmed.<b>Conclusion:</b> BS demonstrated equivalent efficacy and safety to RP at treatment weeks 14 and 30, and long-term safety until week 54 in Japanese RA patients.

Abstract 407. Title: Expanded access to cancer treatments from conversion to neutropenia prophylaxis with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28870106
Abstract: Biosimilar medicines offer significant cost-savings potential over their reference products, which can be re-allocated to provide access to other cancer treatments on a budget-neutral basis.
Simulation study using cost data for the USA under consideration of several prophylaxis patterns.
Potential savings from conversion from reference filgrastim to biosimilar filgrastim-sndz are significant. These savings expand budget-neutral access to novel immunotherapies (obinutuzumab; pembrolizumab) or supportive care (filgrastim-sndz).
The combination of biosimilar savings and expanded access increases the value of cancer care as the same supportive care is provided at lower cost, additional cancer care is enabled at no additional cost, and more patients will have access to cancer care.

Abstract 408. Title: A review of CT-P13: an infliximab biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2014-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24723086
Abstract: CT-P13 (Remsima™; Inflectra™), a biosimilar of reference infliximab (Remicade(®)), is approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in all indications for which reference infliximab is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Infliximab is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α. The CT-P13 infliximab formulation is identical to that of reference infliximab and it has similar physiochemical characteristics. The approval of CT-P13 was based on the results of a rigorous, comparability exercise. This article reviews the results of that exercise, focusing on the clinical evaluation programme. In two well-designed clinical trials, CT-P13 was equivalent to reference infliximab in terms of pharmacokinetic properties in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and in terms of efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In both studies, CT-P13 was generally well tolerated with a similar tolerability profile to that of reference infliximab. Immunogenicity evaluations demonstrated that the proportion of patients developing anti-drug antibodies was similar with each agent. Preliminary data from trial extensions demonstrated that in patients who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13, efficacy was sustained and similar to those who were treated continuously with CT-P13. As with all biosimilar and generic agents, CT-P13 has the potential to reduce treatment costs compared with those of reference infliximab, and modelled analyses predict significant cost savings compared with reference infliximab. In conclusion, CT-P13 is an infliximab biosimilar that provides a useful alternative to reference infliximab in patients requiring infliximab therapy.

Abstract 409. Title: Sowing confusion in the field: the interchangeable use of biosimilar terminology.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30556742
Abstract: The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) created an abbreviated licensure pathway in the United States that allows for the development and approval of biologic products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed reference product. FDA released the draft guidance for industry on Demonstrating Interchangeability with a Reference Product (hereafter referred to as the Draft Interchangeability Guidance) in January 2017. Despite FDA's efforts, there continues to be a great deal of confusion and misinformation surrounding the topic of interchangeability. Here we discuss interchangeability, as well as substitution of biological products, with a focus on the US. Additionally, the separate topic of physician-mediated switching is covered and distinguished from interchangeability and substitution.

Abstract 410. Title: Biosimilarity and Interchangeability: Principles and Evidence: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29344876
Abstract: The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity risk of switching between an originator biologic and a biosimilar or from one biosimilar to another are of potential concern.
The aim was to conduct a systematic literature review of the outcomes of switching between biologics and their biosimilars and identify any evidence gaps.
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from inception to June 2017. Relevant societal meetings were also checked. Peer-reviewed studies reporting efficacy and/or safety data on switching between originator and biosimilar products or from one biosimilar to another were selected. Studies with fewer than 20 switched patients were excluded. Data were extracted on interventions, study population, reason for treatment switching, efficacy outcomes, safety and anti-drug antibodies.
The systematic literature search identified 63 primary publications covering 57 switching studies. The reason for switching was reported as non-medical in 50 studies (23 clinical, 27 observational). Seven studies (all observational) did not report whether the reasons for switching were medical or non-medical. In 38 of the 57 studies, fewer than 100 patients were switched. Follow-up after switching went beyond 1 year in eight of the 57 studies. Of the 57 studies, 33 included statistical analysis of disease activity or patient outcomes; the majority of these studies found no statistically significant differences between groups for main efficacy parameters (based on P < 0.05 or predefined acceptance ranges), although some studies observed changes for some parameters. Most studies reported similar safety profiles between groups.
There are important evidence gaps around the safety of switching between biologics and their biosimilars. Sufficiently powered and appropriately statistically analysed clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies, with long-term follow-ups and multiple switches, are needed to support decision-making around biosimilar switching.

Abstract 411. Title: The challenge of biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2008-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17872902
Abstract: The purpose of this report was to review issues associated with the introduction of alternative versions of biosimilars used in the oncology setting.
Data were obtained by searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, references from relevant English-language articles, and guidelines from the European Medicines Agency.
When biosimilars are approved in EU, they will be considered 'comparable' to the reference product, but this does not ensure therapeutic equivalence. Inherent differences between biosimilars may produce dissimilarities in clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Switching biosimilars should be considered a change in clinical management. Regulatory guidelines have been established for some biosimilar categories but, because of the limited clinical experience with biosimilars at approval, pharmacovigilance programs will be important to establish clinical databases. Guidelines also provide a mechanism for the extrapolation of clinical indications (approved indications for which the biosimilar has not been studied). This may be of concern where differences in biological activity can result in adverse outcomes or when safety is paramount (e.g. stem cell mobilization in healthy donors). These issues should be addressed in biosimilar labeling.
Biosimilars should provide cost savings and greater accessibility to biopharmaceuticals. A thorough knowledge surrounding biosimilars will ensure the appropriate use of biopharmaceuticals.

Abstract 412. Title: Real-world experience of effectiveness of non-medical switch from originator to biosimilar rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2021-Aug-02
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33432358
Abstract: To evaluate the impact of non-medical switch from rituximab originator (RTX-O) to biosimilar (RTX-B) in patients with RA.
Between October 2017 and October 2019, all patients on RTX-O in our centre requiring re-treatment were switched to RTX-B unless declined by the patient or specified by the treating clinician. Switch strategy effectiveness was assessed retrospectively using DAS28-CRP(3) and RTX retention, with patients remaining on RTX-O as a comparator group.
The number of patients switching to RTX-B was 255/337 (75.7%) while 82 (24.3%) remained on RTX-O. There was no difference in DAS28-CRP(3) 4 months post-RTX-B switch vs the same time point post-RTX-O previous cycle (paired data available in 60%). Eighteen-month retention estimates were 75.6% (95% CI: 69.4, 80.7%) for RTX-B group and 82.3% (95% CI: 70.4, 89.8%) for RTX-O [adjusted hazard ratio 1.52 (95% CI: 0.85, 2.73)]. The number of patients who discontinued RTX-B for loss of effectiveness (LOE) was 42/255 (16.5%), five (2.0%) for adverse effects (AEs). Risk of RTX-B discontinuation was associated with comorbidities and ≥2 previous biologic DMARDs. Risk of adverse outcome RTX cessation was associated with comorbidities, and reduced risk with number of previous RTX-O cycles and pre-switch cycle B cell depletion. The number of patients who switched back to RTX-O was 34/255 (13.3%) (LOE: 30, AEs: 4), while 13/255 (5.1%) started other biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs. Of patients who switched back for LOE, 28/30 remained on RTX-O at a mean 7.7 months follow-up.
Non-medical switch to RTX-B was largely effective. Factors associated with RTX-B discontinuation, including comorbidities, previous biologic DMARDs, and RTX-O treatment history, may inform switch decisions. Most patients who switched back to RTX-O for LOE remained on treatment at short-term follow-up.

Abstract 414. Title: Biosimilars: How Can Payers Get Long-Term Savings?
Publication Date: 2016-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26792791
Abstract: The term 'biosimilar' refers to an alternative similar version of an off-patent innovative originator biotechnology product (the 'reference product'). Several biosimilars have been approved in Europe, and a number of top-selling biological medicines have lost, or will lose, patent protection over the next 5 years. We look at the experience in Europe so far. The USA has finally implemented a regulatory route for biosimilar approval. We recommend that European and US governments and payers take a strategic approach to get value for money from the use of biosimilars by (1) supporting and incentivising generation of high-quality comprehensive outcomes data on the effectiveness and safety of biosimilars and originator products; and (2) ensuring that incentives are in place for budget holders to benefit from price competition. This may create greater willingness on the part of budget holders and clinicians to use biosimilar and originator products with comparable outcomes interchangeably, and may drive down prices. Other options, such as direct price cuts for originator products or substitution rules without outcomes data, are likely to discourage biosimilar entry. With such approaches, governments may achieve a one-off cut in originator prices but may put at risk the creation of a more competitive market that would, in time, produce much greater savings. It was the creation of competitive markets for chemical generic drugs-notably, in the USA, the UK and Germany-rather than price control, that enabled payers to achieve the high discounts now taken for granted.

Abstract 415. Title: Biosimilar Epoetin Zeta in Oncology and Haematology: Development and Experience following 6 Years of Use.
Publication Date: 2016-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26426164
Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced anaemia is frequent in cancer patients, with severity depending on the extent of the disease and intensity of treatment. Clinical guidelines recommend erythropoietin therapy to treat or prevent anaemia in some oncology/haematology patients being treated with chemotherapy. The patent expiry of the first-generation erythropoietins has led to the development of biosimilar products, i.e. therapeutic proteins exhibiting comparable quality, safety and efficacy to an existing reference biological medicine, the patent of which has expired. This review summarises the available data set supporting the use of one such biosimilar product, epoetin zeta (Retacrit™) in oncology/haematology. The body of evidence supporting the use of epoetin zeta continues to grow, with post-marketing clinical studies underway to evaluate its longer-term clinical efficacy and safety. Biosimilar medicines have the potential to offer cost savings to health care providers, with the assurance of ongoing risk management programmes to ensure patient safety.

Abstract 416. Title: Longitudinal assessment of the impact of multiple switches between a biosimilar and its reference product on efficacy parameters.
Publication Date: 2018-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29424120
Abstract: Patients, physicians, and health care providers in Europe have more than 10 years of experience with biosimilars. However, there are still debates if switching between a biosimilar and its reference product influences the efficacy of the treatment. In this paper, we address this uncertainty by developing a formal statistical test that can be used for showing that switching has no negative impact on the efficacy of biosimilars. For that, we first introduce a linear mixed-effects model that is used for defining the null hypothesis (switching influences the efficacy) and the alternative hypothesis (switching has no influence on the efficacy). Using this as the foundation of our work, we propose several approaches for testing for changes in the efficacy of the treatment due to switching and discuss the properties of these tests in an extensive simulation study. It is shown that all these methods have advantages and disadvantages and the decision regarding which method is preferred depends on the expectation of a switching assessment. To demonstrate the applicability of the methods in practice, the approaches were applied to the data of the EGALITY study, which compares the reference product Enbrel® (Amgen) with the approved biosimilar Erelzi® (Sandoz).

Abstract 417. Title: Epoetin biosimilars in Europe: five years on.
Publication Date: 2013-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23242745
Abstract: Biosimilars have been developed for several biologic therapeutic agents, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). However, biosimilars cannot be assumed to be completely identical to the reference product, nor can two different biosimilars of the same reference product be considered equivalent. Accordingly, standards for approving biosimilars are distinct from those for generic versions of conventional pharmaceuticals.By late 2007, two biosimilar epoetins (HX575 and SB309) had been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), following a series of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence studies, as well as phase 3 clinical comparability evaluations. Additionally, the results of a limited number of postauthorization interventional or observational studies and quality comparisons were published subsequently on both products.The reported differences in glycosylation profiles between these epoetin biosimilars and their reference product, as well as the lack of long-term safety and efficacy evaluation, could indicate a need to develop a more comprehensive analysis of the available data, and to evaluate the post-authorization real-life data, in order to gain a better understanding of any potential implications of molecular structural or formulation differences on longterm safety and effectiveness.Switching between an original reference ESA and a biosimilar (and possibly also switching between biosimilar versions of the same product) should be regarded as a change in clinical management. Clinicians need to be fully involved in such decisions. Prescribing by brand name will prevent unintentional substitution by pharmacists and allow for effective pharmacovigilance, in accordance with recent EU directives. In this review, the authors have analyzed most of the published information on the two epoetin biosimilars, HX575 and SB309, to highlight the points that healthcare providers may need to consider when assessing an epoetin biosimilar.

Abstract 418. Title: Switching from infliximab to biosimilar in inflammatory bowel disease: overview of the literature and perspective.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019554
Abstract: Biological therapy has revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). After the expiration of patents for biological innovator products, development of biosimilars increased. CT-P13 was the first biosimilar approved for the same indications as the reference product; however, the approval was based on extrapolated data from rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Our aim was to review clinical studies about switching from originator infliximab (IFX-O) to biosimilar infliximab (IXF-B) in IBD, focusing on recently published data and the future of biosimilars.
The PubMed database was searched for original articles published up to 1 December 2018 reporting data on IFX-B in IBD.
A total of 29 studies assessing switching from IFX-O to IFX-B, 14 assessing induction therapy with IFX-B were found. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were discussed. Studies confirm that CT-P13 is safe and equally efficient as the reference product for both induction and maintenance therapy; and that switching from the reference product to biosimilar is non-inferior to continuous biosimilar use. However, efficacy and safety data on Flixabi (SB2) in IBD patients is lacking.
Switching from the originator to a biosimilar in patients with IBD is acceptable, although scientific and clinical evidence is lacking regarding reverse switching, multiple switching and cross-switching among biosimilars in IBD patients.

Abstract 419. Title: The regulatory framework of biosimilars in the European Union.
Publication Date: 2012-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21856438
Abstract: In the European Union (EU), the regulatory policy for biosimilars has enabled different biosimilar products to be marketed through an abridged application, which allows the applicant to submit a reduced dossier. Nevertheless, some manufacturers of biological products that share some characteristics with copies have opted for a full application; therefore, the number and extent of clinical studies required in these cases is increased. Here, we focus on a comparison of recombinant human erythropoietin medicinal products. We analyse and discuss clinical studies submitted to the European Medicines Agency that relate to available biosimilars and biological medicinal products that are authorised with a full dossier. We also discuss the issues of interchangeability and substitution, given that the EU allows each Member State to set their own substitution policies.

Abstract 420. Title: A Markov model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of antiangiogenesis therapy using bevacizumab in advanced cervical cancer.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25766118
Abstract: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in recurrent/persistent and metastatic cervical cancer using recently reported updated survival and toxicology data.
A Markov decision tree based on the Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 randomized trial was created. The 2013 MediCare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule provided costs. In the 5-year model subjects transitioned through the following states: response, progression, minor complications, severe complications, and death. Patients experiencing a health utility per month according to treatment effectiveness were calculated. Because cervical cancer survival is measured in months rather than years, results were reported in both quality adjusted cervical cancer life months and years (QALmonth, QALY), adjusted from a baseline of having advanced cervical cancer during a month.
The estimated total cost of therapy with bevacizumab is approximately 13.2 times that for chemotherapy alone, adding $73,791 per 3.5months (0.29year) of life gained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21.083 per month of added life. The ICER increased to $5775 per month of added life and $24,597/QALmonth ($295,164/QALY) due to the smaller difference in QALmonths. With 75% bevacizumab cost reduction, the ICER is $6737/QALmonth ($80,844/QALY), which translates to $23,580 for the 3.5month (0.29year) gain in OS.
Increased costs are primarily related to the cost of drug and not the management of bevacizumab-induced complications. Cost reductions in bevacizumab result in dramatic declines in the ICER, suggesting that cost reconciliation in advanced cervical cancer may be possible through the availability of biosimilars, and/or less expensive, equally efficacious anti-angiogenesis agents.

Abstract 421. Title: Effectiveness of Switch to Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) Biosimilars versus Maintenance of ESA Originators in the Real-Life Setting: Matched-Control Study in Hemodialysis Patients.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779268
Abstract: In hemodialysis (HD), switching from erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) originators to biosimilars is associated with the need for doses approximately 10% higher, according to industry-driven studies.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy on anemia control of switching from ESA originators to biosimilars in daily clinical practice.
We retrospectively selected consecutive HD patients receiving stable intravenous ESA doses, and who had not been transfused in the previous 6 months, from 12 non-profit Italian centers. Patients switched from originators to biosimilars (n = 163) were matched with those maintained on ESA originators (n = 163) using a propensity score approach. The study duration was 24 weeks, and the primary endpoint was the mean dose difference (MDD), defined as the difference between the switch and control groups of ESA dose changes during the study (time-weighted average ESA dose minus baseline ESA dose).
Age (70 ± 13 years), male sex (63%), diabetes (29%), history of cardiovascular disease (40%), body weight (68 ± 14 kg), vascular access (86% arteriovenous fistula), hemoglobin [Hb] (11.2 ± 0.9 g/dL) and ESA dose (8504 ± 6370 IU/week) were similar in the two groups. Hb remained unchanged during the study in both groups. Conversely, ESA dose remained unchanged in the control group and progressively increased in the switch group from week 8 to 24. The time-weighted average of the ESA dose was higher in the switch group than in the control group (10,503 ± 7389 vs. 7981 ± 5858 IU/week; p = 0.001), leading to a significant MDD of 2423 IU/week (95% confidence interval [CI] 1615-3321), corresponding to a 39.6% (95% CI 24.7-54.6) higher dose of biosimilars compared with originators. The time-weighted average of Hb was 0.2 g/dL lower in the switch group, with a more frequent ESA hyporesponsiveness (14.7 vs. 2.5%). Iron parameters and other resistance factors remained unchanged.
In stable dialysis patients, switching from ESA originators to biosimilars requires 40% higher doses to maintain anemia control.

Abstract 422. Title: Biosimilars in Malaysia: Regulatory Framework, Approved Products, and Adverse Effects.
Publication Date: 2021-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33231863
Abstract: Biosimilars are a cost-effective alternative to original biologic medicines that allow patients access to biologic therapies for various chronic diseases. Our paper aims to provide an overview of biosimilars in Malaysia with emphasis on the comparison of Malaysian guidelines with guidelines from well-established regulatory agencies, a review of biosimilars' market approval and their reported adverse effects (AEs) as well as clinical trials conducted in Malaysia.
We searched the official websites of the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) Malaysia and three other well-established agencies, online databases of Medline® and EMBASE for guidelines on legislation and regulations of biosimilars. Meanwhile, we extracted the reports of AEs involving biosimilars in Malaysia from the NPRA database and for global AEs from the World Health Organisation VigyLize database. The ClinicalTrials.gov Website by the U.S. National Library of Medicines was the source for data on clinical trials.
Malaysia followed the principles of the European Medicines Agency biosimilar regulations and issued their guideline in 2008. Since then, NPRA has approved 24 biosimilar products and recorded 499 AE reports, of which 43 (8.6%) were serious. NPRA has also approved ten Phase III clinical trials in Malaysia with four trials still ongoing.
Malaysia follows a stringent regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars enacted by well-established regulatory agencies to maintain the quality, efficacy and safety of biosimilars. Introducing biosimilars to the Malaysian market would improve patients' accessibility to biologic therapies.

Abstract 423. Title: Overcoming Barriers to the Market Access of Biosimilars in the European Union: The Case of Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibodies.
Publication Date: 2016-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27445826
Abstract: In 2014, six of the top ten blockbuster medicines were monoclonal antibodies. This multibillion-dollar market with expiring patents is the main driver for the development of biosimilar mAbs. With the ever-increasing cost of healthcare and the economic pressure to reduce or sustain healthcare expenses, biosimilars could be instrumental in reducing costs for medication and increasing patient access to treatment.
The aim of this study is to identify and describe the barriers to market access of biosimilar mAbs in the European Union and to analyze how these barriers could be overcome.
A narrative literature review was carried out using the databases PubMed, Embase, and EconLit. Studies were published in English or Dutch. Additionally, the reference list of the articles was checked for relevant studies. Articles and conference papers known to the authors were included as well. Articles were also identified by searching on the website of the Generics and Biosimilars Initiative (GaBI) journal.
Six barriers were identified based on available literature: The manufacturing process, the regulatory process, intellectual property rights, lack of incentive, the impossibility of substitution, and the innovator's reach. These six barriers are presented as a possible framework to study the market access of biosimilar mAbs. Based on the literature search, recommendations can be made to overcome these barriers: (i) invest initially in advanced production processes with the help of single-use technology, experience or outsourcing (ii) gain experience with the regulatory process and establish alignment between stakeholders (iii) limit patent litigation, eliminate evergreening benefits, build out further the unitary patent and unified patent litigation system within the EU (iv) create demand-side policies, disseminate objective information (v) change attitude toward biosimilar switching/substitution, starting with physician, and patient education (vi) differentiate the biosimilar by service offerings, use an appropriate comparator in cost-effectiveness analyses.
Barriers to the market access of biosimilar mAbs could be reduced when more transparency and communication/education is used in all steps toward market access in order to increase the trust in biosimilar mAbs by all stakeholders. Only then biosimilar mAbs will be able to fully capture their cost saving potential.

Abstract 424. Title: Different Policy Measures and Practices between Swedish Counties Influence Market Dynamics: Part 2-Biosimilar and Originator Etanercept in the Outpatient Setting.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945206
Abstract: Diverging approaches towards market entry and uptake of biosimilars, even within a country, leads to regional variation in biosimilar use. This is the case in Sweden, where the 21 county councils control the healthcare budget and offer regional guidance.
This study aimed to analyse the market dynamics of originator and biosimilar etanercept (outpatient setting) in the different counties of Sweden, and examine the influence of local policy measures and practices, in addition to national policy.
This study was performed in three steps: (1) a structured review of the literature on (biosimilar) policies in Sweden; (2) analysis of market data on the counties' originator and biosimilar etanercept uptake (quarter two 2012 to quarter four 2017) provided by IQVIA™; and (3) discussion of findings in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with the national pricing and reimbursement agency, key experts in the county councils of Skåne, Västra Götaland and Stockholm, and an industry representative.
Notwithstanding the existence of a national managed entry agreement for etanercept, wide variations in biosimilar market shares between counties were observed (40-82% in 2017). Over time, early and late adopters of biosimilar etanercept can be distinguished. In quarter four 2017, biosimilar market shares of all counties slightly decreased in accordance with the lower priced originator product from 1 October 2017. As prescriptions for treatment with etanercept are often provided for a year, two approaches are possible to switch patients: active pullback of prescriptions resulting in additional workload, or wait until the patient's next visit. Qualitative analysis indicated that the choice to use the biosimilar or the originator product depends on differences in rebated prices of the biosimilar and originator product, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines, and financial streams and local gainsharing arrangements. Our estimates of current rebated prices and costs after gainsharing for the county councils and Government reveal only limited price differences between products.
Regional variations in use of biosimilar etanercept can be seen although prices are coordinated nationally. This suggests that counties react differently to price differences and highlights the role of local policy and attitudes of stakeholders towards biosimilars and switching. It seems that some counties are hesitant to switch patients, as it is associated with an increased administrative workload that might not be compensated for by savings associated with a lower priced product.

Abstract 425. Title: Different Policy Measures and Practices between Swedish Counties Influence Market Dynamics: Part 1-Biosimilar and Originator Infliximab in the Hospital Setting.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945207
Abstract: Decentralisation of healthcare budgets and issuance of local guidelines means that the use of biosimilars can vary by region within a particular country, for example between the 21 counties of Sweden.
This study aimed to analyse the county-level market dynamics of biosimilar and originator infliximab, which are hospital products, and to examine how local policy measures and practices, in addition to national policy, influenced market dynamics.
We first conducted a literature review on (biosimilar) policies in Sweden, then analysed market data provided by IQVIA™ on uptake of originator and biosimilar infliximab within the different counties (Q2 2012 to Q4 2017), including discounts from (tender) contracts. Biosimilar market shares were calculated with volume data (measured as defined daily doses [DDDs]). We then discussed our findings in semi-structured interviews with the national pricing and reimbursement agency, key experts within the county councils of Skåne, Västra Götaland, and Stockholm, and an industry representative.
Market shares of biosimilar infliximab vary widely between counties (range 18-96% in 2017). The initial uptake of biosimilar infliximab was slow and variable, with abrupt increments in biosimilar market shares coinciding with expiration of contracts for the originator product. Different approaches taken by counties to achieve a low cost per DDD of infliximab were identified, i.e., a rapid switch to the biosimilar (Skåne), a delayed switch to the biosimilar (Stockholm), or no switch to the biosimilar when a favourable price on the originator product could be obtained (Västra Götaland). Quantitative analysis showed that 59% of the variability in biosimilar market shares could be explained by the relative difference in discounted price between the biosimilar and the originator product. In addition, qualitative analysis indicated the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines and initiatives, and whose budget it affects as drivers in the decision-making process.
Variations in the market share of biosimilar infliximab between the Swedish counties is largely explained by the discounted price difference between biosimilar and originator product, and counties used different strategies to leverage such biosimilar competition. Additionally, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines and gainsharing arrangements appeared to play a role in infliximab market dynamics in counties.

Abstract 426. Title: Policies for biosimilar uptake in Europe: An overview.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29284064
Abstract: Across European countries, differences exist in biosimilar policies, leading to variations in uptake of biosimilars and divergences in savings all over Europe.
The aim of this article is to provide an overview of different initiatives and policies that may influence the uptake of biosimilars in different European countries. Recommendations will be formulated on how to create sustainable uptake.
An overview of policies on biosimilars was obtained via a questionnaire, supplemented with relevant articles. Topics were organized in five themes: availability, pricing, reimbursement, demand-side policies, and recommendations to enhance uptake.
In all countries studied, biological medicines are available. Restrictions are mainly dependent on local organization of the healthcare system. Countries are willing to include biosimilars for reimbursement, but for commercial reasons they are not always marketed. In two thirds of countries, originator and biosimilar products may be subjected to internal reference pricing systems. Few countries have implemented specific incentives targeting physicians. Several countries are implementing pharmacist substitution; however, the scope and rules governing such substitution tend to vary between these countries. Reported educational policies tend to target primarily physicians, whereas fewer initiatives were reported for patients. Recommendations as proposed by the different country experts ranged from the need for information and communication on biosimilars to competitive pricing, more support for switching and guidance on substitution.
Most countries have put in place specific supply-side policies for promoting access to biosimilars. To supplement these measures, we propose that investments should be made to clearly communicate on biosimilars and educate stakeholders. Especially physicians need to be informed on the entry and use of biosimilars in order to create trust. When physicians are well-informed on the treatment options, further incentives should be offered to prescribe biosimilars. Gainsharing can be used as an incentive to prescribe, dispense or use biosimilars. This approach, in combination with binding quota, may support a sustainable biosimilar market.

Abstract 427. Title: A Look at the History of Biosimilar Adoption: Characteristics of Early and Late Adopters of Infliximab and Etanercept Biosimilars in Subregions of England, Scotland and Wales - A Mixed Methods Study.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33306186
Abstract: Regions within England, Scotland and Wales show variation in rate of adoption of biosimilar infliximab and etanercept.
This study aims to examine how local decisions and practices in regions within England, Scotland and Wales might explain initial variation in market dynamics of biosimilar and originator infliximab and etanercept.
Market data provided by the National Health Service (NHS) on biosimilar and originator infliximab and etanercept uptake were analysed for the 10 historical regions of England, 14 health boards in Scotland and 7 health boards in Wales (2015-2018). Findings were discussed in ten semi-structured interviews: on a national level with an industry representative (1), on a regional level with NHS employees in England (6), Scotland (1) and Wales (1), and on a local level with a representative of a clinical commissioning group in England (1).
Tenders for infliximab and etanercept in England, Scotland and Wales have consistently resulted in a biosimilar as the best value biological. Early and late biosimilar adopters are seen, with overall convergence towards high biosimilar market shares over time. Qualitative results suggest that biosimilar adoption was positively influenced by (a) a price difference between biosimilar and originator product making it worthwhile to switch patients; (b) a good relationship between commissioner and provider in England resulting in gain share agreements; (c) leadership on biosimilars in regional NHS offices in England or Scottish and Welsh health boards; (d) key opinion leaders or leading hospitals that start using biosimilars early and gain experience.
This study has shown that the savings potential drives biosimilar use. Regions with a proactive attitude, good stakeholder relationships, and clinician engagement were identified as early adopters.

Abstract 428. Title: Switching Between Reference Biologics and Biosimilars for the Treatment of Rheumatology, Gastroenterology, and Dermatology Inflammatory Conditions: Considerations for the Clinician.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28623625
Abstract: Biosimilars of the reference biologic therapeutics infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and rituximab are entering the market. Clinical and real-world data on the effects of reference → biosimilar switching are limited. This review was carried out to assess the current body of switching data.
Fifty-three switching studies were identified. Infliximab publications covered CT-P13 (25 studies), SB2 (1), infliximab NK (1), and unspecified infliximab biosimilars (2). Etanercept publications covered SB4 (2) and GP2015 (2). Adalimumab publications covered ABP 501 (2) and SB5 (1). Rituximab publications covered CT-P10 (1). Efficacy and safety data generally showed no differences between patients who switched treatments versus those who did not. No differences were seen pre- and post-switch. Immunogenicity data were presented in 19/37 (51%) studies. Additional data from switching studies of these therapies are still required, as is continuing pharma-covigilance. Switching should remain a case-by-case clinical decision made by the physician and patient on an individual basis supported by scientific evidence.

Abstract 429. Title: Biosimilar medicines - their use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Position statement of the Working Group of the Polish National Consultant in Gastroenterology.
Publication Date: 2014-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24868291
Abstract: Biological medical products are drugs whose active components are produced only by living, genetically modified organisms or live cell cultures. Patents and exclusivity for most biopharmaceuticals has either expired or will expire soon, which enables biotechnological companies to introduce similar biological products. The problem of replacing a biological medicine with a biosimilar in the course of therapy remains open. In this statement, the Working Group of the Polish National Consultant in Gastroenterology, in the absence of data regarding bioequivalence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, does not recommend switching from original biological medicine to its biosimilar analogue in the course of treatment in inflammatory disease patients; however, this may change after receiving the results of controlled studies regarding bioequivalence in this group.

Abstract 431. Title: Scientific rationale behind the development and approval of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in Europe.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26395832
Abstract: Biosimilars are drugs developed to be highly similar to their originator biologic (or 'reference medicinal product') with no clinically meaningful differences in purity, efficacy or safety. Production of biologics and biosimilars is highly complex and sensitive, with any change in manufacturing process having a potential impact on efficacy and safety. This review provides an overview of the manufacturing process for these drugs and considers the implications of any process changes. The scientific rationale underlying the regulatory comparability exercise for process-changed reference medicinal products and biosimilars is also discussed, as is the issue of 'switchability' from a reference medicinal product to its biosimilar. CT-P13 (Remsima(®), Inflectra(®)), a biosimilar of infliximab, is used as a case study to discuss these issues.

Abstract 432. Title: [Biosimilars and the efficiency principle].
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723913
Abstract: Biosimilars are subject to the efficiency evaluation according to section 106 Social Code Book Five (SGB V). The specific evaluation method influences the physician's prescription behaviour. In the case of an individual prescription limit evaluation (Richtgrößenprüfung), the prescription of biosimilars would usually not result in recourse but, as a start, in the initiation of the evaluation proceedings. Starting from 2017, the individual prescription limit evaluation will be cancelled. The active ingredient evaluation (Wirkstoffprüfung) expected instead at a regional level may provide for biosimilar to original drug ratios and result in recourses if these ratios are missed. First agreements on specific evaluation proceedings at a regional level are expected for this year.

Abstract 433. Title: The Law and Ethics of Switching from Biologic to Biosimilar in Canada.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905067
Abstract: Governments and financial institutions in several jurisdictions are planning or implementing nonmedical/'forced' switches by cutting drug coverage for reference biologics and funding only less expensive biosimilars. Switches raise numerous ethical and legal challenges, as the drugs are framed as not being identical and, despite strong evidence for noninferiority of some biosimilars, there is controversy over whether switching can sometimes lead to adverse events. Canadian law generally requires physicians to give precedence to their patients' best interests over social interests such as cost containment. The primacy of patients' interests is also clearly reflected in professional policies and codes of ethics. Moreover, physicians are obligated to disclose everything a reasonable person in the patient's position would want to know when obtaining informed consent for treatment, including addressing not only scientific information but also relevant social controversy about nonmedical switches. Under Canadian law, physicians may be obligated to tell patients about the ability to access unfunded biologics, even if patients lack the resources to obtain them. In sum, while there is no inherent right to funding for reference biologics in Canada, physicians in some circumstances may have a legal obligation as fiduciaries to advocate on behalf of patients to remain on a reference biologic. At a minimum, the controversy surrounding switching will necessitate, as part of the consent process, a robust and thorough disclosure of relevant risks, benefits and reasonable alternatives.

Abstract 434. Title: Biosimilars in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases: The Dutch experience.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524082
Abstract: These days, the use of biosimilars for the treatment of bio-naive patients is well established. However, the transition of patients being treated with a bio-originator to its biosimilar is still a topic of discussion. The main issue is which approach to use when initiating the non-medical transition. The first real-world examples contain both mandatory and non-mandatory approaches, resulting in a variety of acceptance and discontinuation rates. At this moment a non-mandatory approach, based on shared decision making, is preferred by international guidelines and the Task Force on the Use of Biosimilars to Treat Rheumatological Diseases. However, clear definitions of mandatory and non-mandatory are lacking, as a result of which these terms may be wrongly used in some studies. This article aims to provide an overview of transition approaches used in the Netherlands, and how the approach used relates to acceptance and discontinuation rates of the biosimilar.

Abstract: The European Medicines Agency's recent approval of biosimilars and their sudden appearance on the market will revolutionize the way physicians treat the severe conditions for which biologics have had a major impact. In the field of rheumatology, these agents are especially important because most new treatments are based on this kind of medication and because patents on the original drugs are expiring. To use these new medications, the treating physician must read and understand the clinical trials related to biosimilars. These studies are not the typical superiority trials in which new agents are compared with standard treatment; rather, they evaluate different formulas to determine whether they are no better or worse. This article summarizes the clinical aspects of drug development with regard to the efficacy and safety of these new medications.

Abstract 436. Title: A conserved G₁ regulatory circuit promotes asynchronous behavior of nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm.
Publication Date: 2010-Sep-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20930528
Abstract: Synthesis and accumulation of conserved cell cycle regulators such as cyclins are thought to promote G₁/S and G₂/M transitions in most eukaryotes. When cells at different stages of the cell cycle are fused to form heterokaryons, the shared complement of regulators in the cytoplasm induces the nuclei to become synchronized. However, multinucleate fungi often display asynchronous nuclear division cycles, even though the nuclei inhabit a shared cytoplasm. Similarly, checkpoints can induce nuclear asynchrony in multinucleate cells by arresting only the nucleus that receives damage. The cell biological basis for nuclear autonomy in a common cytoplasm is not known. Here we show that in the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, sister nuclei born from one mitosis immediately lose synchrony in the subsequent G₁ interval. A conserved G₁ transcriptional regulatory circuit involving the Rb-analogue Whi5p promotes the asynchronous behavior yet Whi5 protein is uniformly distributed among nuclei throughout the cell cycle. The homologous Whi5p circuit in S. cerevisiae employs positive feedback to promote robust and coherent entry into the cell cycle. We propose that positive feedback in this same circuit generates timing variability in a multinucleate cell. These unexpected findings indicate that a regulatory program whose products (mRNA transcripts) are translated in a common cytoplasm can nevertheless promote variability in the individual behavior of sister nuclei.

Abstract 437. Title: Infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 is interchangeable with its originator for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in real world practice.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31422647
Abstract: An interim analysis of post-marketing surveillance of CT-P13, an infliximab biosimilar, was performed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Patients were prospectively enrolled between November 2014 and March 2017, after the launch of CT-P13 in Japan, and case report forms of patients followed for at least 4 months were analyzed as of July 2018.
Of 523 patients in the analysis set, 372 remained on CT-P13 therapy, while 54 (20.2%) of 267 patients with Crohn's disease, and 97 (37.9%) of 256 patients with ulcerative colitis were withdrawn during follow-up. A total of 144 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 106 patients (20.3%). Infusion reaction was the most frequent ADR observed in 49 patients (9.4%). Efficacy parameters decreased immediately after the start of treatment in naïve patients to anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody. In the patients switched from originator infliximab for nonmedical reasons, the decreased parameters due to proceeded treatment with the originator were maintained in low ranges, and the treatment continuation rate was high with low ADR incidence. In contrast, in patients switched for medical reasons such as adverse event or loss of response, the incidence of ADRs was high. However, the efficacy parameters were improved, and the treatment continuation rate was not significantly different from that of the naïve patient group.
In this interim analysis, CT-P13 was comparable to the originator infliximab with respect to ADRs and efficacy, and is therefore considered to be a cost-efficient interchangeable biosimilar for Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract 438. Title: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of JR-051, a biosimilar of agalsidase beta, in healthy adults and patients with Fabry disease: Phase I and II/III clinical studies.
Publication Date: 2020-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32389574
Abstract: Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal disease, in which mutations in the gene encoding α-galactosidase A result in progressive cellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in various organs including the skin, kidney, and heart, often leading to life-threatening conditions. Enzyme replacement therapy is currently the standard therapy for the disease, to which two α-galactosidase A formulations have been approved: agalsidase α (Replagal®, Shire) and agalsidase β (Fabrazyme®, Sanofi). We have recently developed a biosimilar of agalsidase β, JR-051, and investigated its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to assess its bioequivalence to agalsidase β. In a randomized phase I study, healthy adult male volunteers were treated with JR-051 or agalsidase β and the pharmacokinetics of the drugs were compared. The ratio of geometric means (90% confidence interval [CI]) of the AUC<sub>0</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>24</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> for JR-051 over agalsidase β were 0.91 (0.8294, 1.0082) and 0.90 (0.7992, 1.0125), respectively. In a 52-week, single-arm, phase II/III study, patients with Fabry disease switched therapy from agalsidase β to JR-051 to evaluate its pharmacodynamics. The mean (95% CI) plasma GL-3 concentrations at weeks 26 and 52 relative to pre-JR-051 administration were 1.03 (0.91, 1.15) and 0.96 (0.86, 1.06), respectively, which were within the pre-determined bioequivalence acceptance range (0.70, 1.43). The mean (95% CI) plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-3) concentrations at weeks 26 and 52 relative to pre-JR-051 administration were 1.07 (0.92, 1.23) and 1.13 (1.03, 1.22), respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular mass index, as renal and cardiac function indicators, showed no notable changes from baseline throughout the study period, and no new safety concerns were identified. In conclusion, these studies demonstrated bioequivalence of JR-051 to agalsidase β in terms of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. JR-051 offers a potential new treatment option for patients with Fabry disease.

Abstract 439. Title: Efficacy of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic literature review informing the 2013 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2014-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24399231
Abstract: To update the evidence for the efficacy of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to inform the European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) Task Force treatment recommendations.
Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published between January 2009 and February 2013 on infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab-pegol, golimumab, anakinra, abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab and biosimilar DMARDs (bsDMARDs) in phase 3 development. Abstracts from 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and 2011-2013 EULAR conferences were obtained.
Fifty-one full papers, and 57 abstracts were identified. The randomised controlled trials (RCT) confirmed the efficacy of bDMARD+conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) versus csDMARDs alone (level 1B evidence). There was some additional evidence for the use of bDMARD monotherapy, however bDMARD and MTX combination therapy for all bDMARD classes was more efficacious (1B). Clinical and radiographic responses were high with treat-to-target strategies. Earlier improvement in signs and symptoms were seen with more intensive initial treatment strategies, but outcomes were similar upon addition of bDMARDs in patients with insufficient response to MTX. In general, radiographic progression was lower with bDMARD use, mainly due to initial treatment effects. Although patients may achieve bDMARD- and drug-free remission, maintenance of clinical responses was higher with bDMARD continuation (1B), but bDMARD dose reduction could be applied (1B). There was still no RCT data for bDMARD switching.
The systematic literature review confirms efficacy of biological DMARDs in RA. It addresses different treatment strategies with the potential for reduction in therapy, particularly with early disease control, and highlights emerging therapies.

Abstract 440. Title: Efficacy of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic literature review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28283512
Abstract: To update the evidence for the efficacy of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to inform European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Task Force treatment recommendations.
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for phase III or IV (or phase II, if these studies were lacking) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2013 and February 2016. Abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR conferences were obtained.
The RCTs confirmed greater efficacy with a bDMARD+conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) versus a csDMARDs alone (level 1A evidence). Using a treat-to-target strategy approach, commencing and escalating csDMARD therapy and adding a bDMARD in cases of non-response, is an effective approach (1B). If a bDMARD had failed, improvements in clinical response were seen on switching to another bDMARD (1A), but no clear advantage was seen for switching to an agent with another mode of action. Maintenance of clinical response in patients in remission or low disease activity was best when continuing rather than stopping a bDMARD, but bDMARD dose reduction or 'spacing' was possible, with a substantial proportion of patients achieving bDMARD-free remission (2B). RCTs have also demonstrated efficacy of several new bDMARDs and biosimilar DMARDs (1B).
This systematic literature review consistently confirmed the previously reported efficacy of bDMARDs in RA and provided additional information on bDMARD switching and dose reduction.

Abstract 441. Title: Low-molecular-weight heparin biosimilars: potential implications for clinical practice. Australian Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Biosimilar Working Group (ALBW).
Publication Date: 2014-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24816308
Abstract: A working group of clinicians and scientists was formed to review the clinical considerations for use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) biosimilars. LMWH are biological molecules of significant complexity; the full complexity of chemical structure is still to be elucidated. LMWH biosimilars are products that are biologically similar to their reference product and rely on clinical data from a reference product to establish safety and efficacy. The complex nature of LMWH molecules means that it is uncertain whether a LMWH biosimilar is chemically identical to its reference product; this introduces the possibility of differences in activity and immunogenicity. The challenge for regulators and clinicians is to evaluate the level of evidence required to demonstrate that a LMWH is sufficiently similar to the reference product. The consensus opinion of the working group is that prior to clinical use a LMWH biosimilar should have proven efficacy and safety, similar to the reference product with prospective studies, which should be confirmed with a proactive post-marketing pharmacovigilance programme.

Abstract 442. Title: Cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptor desensitization sustains Ca2+-dependent gene expression.
Publication Date: 2012-Jan-09
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22230957
Abstract: Receptor desensitization is a universal mechanism to turn off a biological response; in this process, the ability of a physiological trigger to activate a cell is lost despite the continued presence of the stimulus. Receptor desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors involves uncoupling of the receptor from its G-protein or second-messenger pathway followed by receptor internalization. G-protein-coupled cysteinyl leukotriene type I (CysLT1) receptors regulate immune-cell function and CysLT1 receptors are an established therapeutic target for allergies, including asthma. Desensitization of CysLT1 receptors arises predominantly from protein-kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of three serine residues in the receptor carboxy terminus. Physiological concentrations of the receptor agonist leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) evoke repetitive cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations, reflecting regenerative Ca(2+) release from stores, which is sustained by Ca(2+) entry through store-operated calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. CRAC channels are tightly linked to expression of the transcription factor c-fos, a regulator of numerous genes important to cell growth and development. Here we show that abolishing leukotriene receptor desensitization suppresses agonist-driven gene expression in a rat cell line. Mechanistically, stimulation of non-desensitizing receptors evoked prolonged inositol-trisphosphate-mediated Ca(2+) release, which led to accelerated Ca(2+)-dependent slow inactivation of CRAC channels and a subsequent loss of excitation-transcription coupling. Hence, rather than serving to turn off a biological response, reversible desensitization of a Ca(2+) mobilizing receptor acts as an 'on' switch, sustaining long-term signalling in the immune system.

Abstract 443. Title: Cost-effectiveness of different interferon beta products for relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: Decision analysis based on long-term clinical data and switchable treatments.
Publication Date: 2013-Jun-22
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800250
Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly debilitating immune mediated disorder and the second most common cause of neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults. Iran is amongst high MS prevalence countries (50/100,000). Economic burden of MS is a topic of important deliberation in economic evaluations study. Therefore determining of cost-effectiveness interferon beta (INF β) and their copied biopharmaceuticals (CBPs) and biosimilars products is significant issue for assessment of affordability in Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).
A literature-based Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of three INF βs products compared with placebo for managing a hypothetical cohort of patients diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) in Iran from a societal perspective. Health states were based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Disease progression transition probabilities for symptom management and INF β therapies were obtained from natural history studies and multicenter randomized controlled trials and their long term follow up for RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). A cross sectional study has been developed to evaluate cost and utility. Transitions among health states occurred in 2-years cycles for fifteen cycles and switching to other therapies was allowed. Calculations of costs and utilities were established by attachment of decision trees to the overall model. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY) for all available INF β products (brands, biosimilars and CBPs) were considered. Both costs and utilities were discounted. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of model.
ICER for Avonex, Rebif and Betaferon was 18712, 11832, 15768 US Dollars ($) respectively when utility attained from literature review has been considered. ICER for available CBPs and biosimilars in Iran was $847, $6964 and $11913.
The Markov pharmacoeconomics model determined that according to suggested threshold for developing countries by world health organization, all brand INF β products are cost effective in Iran except Avonex. The best strategy among INF β therapies is CBP intramuscular INF β-1a (Cinnovex). Results showed that a policy of encouraging accessibility to CBPs and biosimilars could make even high technology products cost-effective in LMICs.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29481732
Abstract: To explore the variables associated with initial favorable power Doppler (PD) ultrasound (US) response induced by biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
We have been prospectively investigating the course of active RA patients using US after the introduction of b/tsDMARDs in the Kyushu region of Japan since June 2013. A total of 150 patients have completed the first 6 months of observation at present and have been evaluated. US was assessed in 22 joints of bilateral hands using gray-scale and PD images on a scale from 0-3. The sum of these scores was used as the indicator of US disease activity. We defined PD remission as attaining a total PD score of 0 at 6 months and investigated the associated variables by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
The total PD and gray-scale scores and the clinical composite measures significantly improved at 6 months, whereas these reductions were less in bDMARD switchers as compared with bDMARD-naive patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that short disease duration, the absence of any previous use of bDMARDs, and low total PD scores at baseline were independent predictors of PD remission at 6 months.
This present prospective US cohort has for the first time shown the variables that are associated with initial PD response to b/tsDMARDs.

Abstract 445. Title: Non-medical Switching from Originator Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors to Their Biosimilars: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials and Real-World Studies.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084060
Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are widely used biologics for the treatment of several chronic inflammatory diseases. The launch of anti-TNF biosimilars has introduced the possibility of non-medical switching between originator biologics and their biosimilars. However, the potential clinical and patient-reported consequences of non-medical switching remain largely unknown, as much of the evidence comes from poorly or uncontrolled real-world evidence (RWE) studies that often have an element of bias and nonstandardized outcome measures. To appropriately evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of non-medical switching from an originator to its biosimilar, we propose that seven key study design elements should be considered when assessing the existing evidence: studies should be (1) randomized and double-blind, (2) adequately controlled, and (3) adequately powered; include (4) multiple switching, (5) an assessment of immunogenicity, and (6) adequate follow-up duration; and (7) report individual patient-level outcomes. This systematic review assessed the robustness and consistency of the current non-medical switching evidence, with a focus on TNF inhibitors. A comprehensive literature search (January 2012-February 2018) identified 98 publications corresponding to 91 studies (17 randomized controlled trials and 74 RWE studies) describing non-medical switching from a TNF inhibitor originator to its biosimilar. When assessing the totality of this evidence, none of the non-medical switching studies conducted to date were found to use all seven of the key design elements, and the absence of these elements dilutes the robustness of the data. Furthermore, discontinuation rates varied widely among studies (0-87%), suggesting heterogeneity and inconclusiveness of the current efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity evidence, particularly at an individual patient level. Therefore, patients should not be indiscriminately switched from an originator TNF inhibitor to its biosimilar for non-medical reasons. Switching decisions should remain between the treating physicians and their patients and be made on a case-by-case basis, relying upon robust scientific evidence.

Abstract 446. Title: Regulation of biosimilar medicines and current perspectives on interchangeability and policy.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30187103
Abstract: Competition arising from the increasing availability of biosimilar medicines has resulted in healthcare savings and has provided greater patient access to high cost therapeutics in Europe. The biosimilar market in the USA is relatively new so the full impact of biosimilar availability remains to be seen. Educational initiatives relating to the use of biosimilar medicines are currently being undertaken by regulators, policy makers and industry. The debate on biosimilars has moved on from the appropriateness of the regulatory framework which governs their approval, to the practice of interchangeability. Interchangeability is an important issue for healthcare professionals but different definitions and regulatory frameworks exist in the USA and Europe. In the USA, an interchangeable biological product is a biosimilar which may be substituted by a pharmacist, subject to local State policies. The interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference medicine will be evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in cases where approval as an 'interchangeable product' is sought. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) does not assess or make recommendations on interchangeability, therefore, in Europe, interchangeability does not mean substitution but is generally physician-led or driven by national policy. This paper provides an overview of the regulation of biosimilar medicines. Challenges associated with the demonstration of interchangeability and practical considerations relating to switching are also discussed. Finally, we present policies that have been adopted to date in several European countries, the USA and Australia, which aim to promote the use of biosimilar medicines.

Abstract 447. Title: Assessing awareness and attitudes of healthcare professionals on the use of biosimilar medicines: A survey of physicians and pharmacists in Ireland.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28666961
Abstract: Increasing numbers of biosimilar medicines are becoming available. The objective of this survey was to assess awareness of and attitudes to biosimilars amongst physicians (medical specialists and General Practitioners (GPs)) and community pharmacists in Ireland. Physicians were invited to complete an online questionnaire during April and May 2016. Community pharmacists received a postal questionnaire in August 2015. Responses from 102 medical specialists, 253 GPs and 125 community pharmacists were analysed. The majority of medical specialists (85%) and pharmacists (77%) claimed to be either very familiar or familiar with the term biosimilar, whereas many GPs (60%) were unable to define or had never heard of the term. One in five (21%) healthcare professionals responded that biosimilars were the same as generic medicines. The majority of medical specialists opposed pharmacist-led substitution of biological medicines but some thought it could be appropriate if agreed with the clinician in advance. Medical specialists who prescribe biosimilars (n = 43) were more likely to do so on treatment initiation (67%), than switch a patient from an originator medicine to a biosimilar (28%). The findings will aid the design of educational initiatives for healthcare professionals and highlight attitudes of healthcare professionals to biosimilars, so informing regulators, policy makers and industry.

Abstract 448. Title: The Biosimilar Nocebo Effect? A Systematic Review of Double-Blinded Versus Open-Label Studies.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30247100
Abstract: Several authors have hypothesized that adverse drug events (ADEs) upon switching from reference biologics to biosimilar products are related to the nocebo effect. However, a thorough and current review of the existing literature has not been conducted.
To evaluate if patient and/or physician knowledge of a switch from a reference biologic product to a biosimilar product was associated with an increase in ADEs likely to be susceptible to the nocebo effect.
Studies reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of a switch from a reference product to a biosimilar product were reviewed. Biologics with FDA-approved biosimilars in the United States were considered for review, including adalimumab, bevacizumab, etanercept, and infliximab. Studies were identified by searching controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms) and keywords within MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Embase. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify subjective and objective complications in double-blinded and single-blinded or open-label studies.
Thirty-one trials including 3,271 patients were reviewed in the full analysis. Median discontinuation rates for any reason were 14.3% (range = 0.0-33.3) in open-label studies compared with 6.95% (range = 5.2-11.0) in double-blinded studies. Discontinuation rates for ADEs were 5.6% (range = 0.0-24.2) in open-label studies versus 3.1% (range = 2.0-5.2) in double-blinded studies, suggesting the nocebo effect does affect biosimilar adoption. Subgroup analyses of antidrug antibody (ADA) development and infusion reactions were similar between infliximab open-label and double-blinded studies. Discontinuation rates for any reason, for ADEs, and for lack of efficacy were generally higher in infliximab open-label trials compared with double-blinded trials. Etanercept biosimilar discontinuation rates for any reason were similar between study designs; however, incidences of injection site reactions and discontinuation rates for ADEs were higher in double-blinded compared with open-label study designs.
Current evidence is insufficient to confirm a biosimilar nocebo effect, although higher discontinuation rates in infliximab biosimilar open-label studies support this theory. Further studies are needed to evaluate the existence of a biosimilar nocebo effect.

Abstract 449. Title: Safety and efficacy of trastuzumab administered as a 30-min infusion in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535535
Abstract: To investigate the safety and efficacy of 30-min maintenance infusions of trastuzumab in advanced gastric cancer positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
This was a retrospective study conducted across five Korean hospitals in patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with first-line, 3-weekly trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. The first dose of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg) was administered as a 90-min infusion, with all subsequent maintenance infusions (6 mg/kg) given over 30 min. The primary aim was to investigate infusion-related reactions and cardiac events with 30-min infusions of trastuzumab. Objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival were secondary endpoints.
The study included 128 patients (efficacy population), of whom 123 received both induction and maintenance infusions and formed the safety population. The median age was 63 years; 80% were presenting for the first time with metastatic disease, and 94% were treated with trastuzumab plus capecitabine/cisplatin. Infusion-related reactions were observed in 32 of 123 patients (26%). There were no cardiac events. The most frequent adverse events were anorexia and nausea, followed by vomiting, fatigue, mucositis, sensory neuropathy, and hand-foot syndrome. Most events were grade 1-2 and were manageable. No patient discontinued study treatment due to adverse events. The objective response rate was 63%, and included 6 complete responses.
Trastuzumab 30-min maintenance infusions were well tolerated with a good safety profile, and resulted in sustained efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.

Abstract 450. Title: Efficacy of once or twice weekly administration of epoetin κ in patients receiving hemodialysis: A retrospective study.
Publication Date: 2014-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24348759
Abstract: Several clinically approved recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) preparations, such as epoetin-β, epoetin-δ and the epoetin-α derivative, darbepoetin-α, have been commercially produced. Since the expiration of patent protection, a number of novel rEPO biosimilars have been approved on the world market. In 2010, epoetin-κ, which is biosimilar to epoetin-α, was clinically approved. Epoetin-κ is a biopharmaceutical product that is based on serum-free media following master cell bank preparation. The present study analyzes the results obtained during a six-month observation period, in which the administration of epoetin-β was switched to that of epoetin-κ. In a cohort of patients receiving chronic dialysis, who were clinically in a state of relative calm and were in control of their renal anemia, it was possible to sustain good control of the anemia by reducing the frequency of the epoetin-β administration from the conventional and empirically determined three times a week to twice a week, and further to once a week. Furthermore, the good control was maintained upon changing from the administration of epoetin-β to that of epoetin-κ. Moreover, three months subsequent to this switch, the degree of instability observed among the patients had decreased. Despite the fact that the situation following the changeover requires further investigation, it may be concluded that the results obtained in this study are indicative of the clinical equivalence and efficacy of epoetin-κ.

Abstract 451. Title: The emergence of biosimilar insulin preparations--a cause for concern?
Publication Date: 2012-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23046400
Abstract: Several biopharmaceuticals, including insulin and insulin analogs, are, or shortly will be, off-patent, thereby providing an opportunity for companies to attempt to manufacture "copies" commonly referred to as biosimilars and also known as follow-on biologics. Reassurance that such copy biologics are equally safe and effective as the conventional products is essential. It is important for the clinician to consider what information is therefore necessary for such assurances. Biopharmaceuticals, produced from living organisms and manufactured by complex processes, differ in many respects from chemically derived drugs. The biological source materials and manufacturing processes for non-innovator biologics may differ considerably from those used for producing the innovator substance. Differences between innovator and non-innovator products can be identified analytically (e.g., batch-to-batch consistency, product stability along side clinical safety). This provides a strong argument for caution before automatic substitution of conventional products (e.g., insulin by biosimilars). Several non-innovator insulins, including insulin analogs (while still patent-protected), are already available in many countries. Many of these lack rigorous regulations for biosimilar approval and pharmacovigilance. Recently an application for a biosimilar recombinant human insulin was withdrawn by the European Medicines Agency because of safety and efficacy concerns. Therefore, every biosimilar insulin and insulin analog should be assessed by well-defined globally harmonized preclinical and clinical studies followed by post-marketing pharmacovigilance programs, in the interest of people with diabetes worldwide.

Abstract 452. Title: Clinical similarity of biosimilar ABP 501 to adalimumab in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III study.
Publication Date: 2017-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28291552
Abstract: ABP 501 is a biosimilar of adalimumab.
We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of ABP 501 with adalimumab.
This 52-week, double-blind study randomized patients with moderate to severe psoriasis to ABP 501 or adalimumab. At week 16, those with 50% or more improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline on ABP 501 continued the same treatment, whereas adalimumab-treated patients were rerandomized to adalimumab or ABP 501. Clinical similarity in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index percent improvement from baseline to week 16 (primary end point) was established if the point estimate of treatment difference and its 2-sided 95% confidence interval between groups was within equivalence margin of ±15. Patients, including those undergoing a single transition at week 16, were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity.
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index percent improvement at week 16 was 80.9 for ABP 501 and 83.1 for adalimumab (least-square mean difference -2.18 [95% confidence interval -7.39 to 3.02]). Adverse events (67.2% [117/174] vs 63.6% [110/173]) and antidrug antibody incidence (55.2% [96/174] vs 63.6% [110/173]) for ABP 501 vs adalimumab were similar. Safety, including immunogenicity, was similar among groups after single transition (week 20).
The 52-week data are not reported here.
ABP 501 was shown to be clinically similar to adalimumab. Safety and immunogenicity were not impacted immediately after single transition (adalimumab to ABP 501).

Abstract 453. Title: Clinical similarity of the biosimilar ABP 501 compared with adalimumab after single transition: long-term results from a randomized controlled, double-blind, 52-week, phase III trial in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28755394
Abstract: ABP 501, a U.S.A. Food and Drug Administration- and European Medicines Agency-approved biosimilar, is highly similar to adalimumab in structure, function and pharmacokinetics.
To demonstrate similarity in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ABP 501 vs. adalimumab for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (clinical trial: NCT01970488).
Patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive ABP 501 or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. At week 16, patients with ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score were eligible to continue to week 52. Patients receiving ABP 501 continued; adalimumab patients were rerandomized (1 : 1) to continue adalimumab or undergo a single transition to ABP 501. Key efficacy assessments included percentage PASI improvement from baseline, PASI responders and mean change in affected body surface area from baseline to weeks 16, 32 and 50. Safety was monitored via adverse events (AEs) and antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed.
A total of 308 patients were rerandomized at week 16 (ABP 501/ABP 501, n = 152; adalimumab/adalimumab, n = 79; adalimumab/ABP 501, n = 77). PASI percentage improvements from baseline were similar across groups for weeks 16, 32 and 50 (range: 85·8-88·2%), with no significant differences detected across groups in percentages of PASI 50, 75, 90 and 100 responders. Changes from baseline in percentage body surface area affected were similar across groups and time points. No new safety signals were detected. AEs were balanced between groups. Percentages of patients with binding and neutralizing ADAs were similar across treatments.
ABP 501 and adalimumab have similar clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles over 52 weeks, including after single transition, in this patient population.

Abstract 454. Title: The Legal and Regulatory Status of Biosimilars: How Product Naming and State Substitution Laws May Impact the United States Healthcare System.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26237983
Abstract: Alongside the constitutional controversy ultimately addressed by the Supreme Court, the colossal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) ushered in a new paradigm for regulation of biologics by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nestled within the expansive ACA, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) set forth an abbreviated pathway to market for "biosimilar" and "interchangeable" biological products. While the current BPCIA implementation debate focuses chiefly on the scope of scientific and technical assessments by the FDA and the effect on the emergent biosimilar industry, two issues will prove essential for determinations of access to and costs of the resulting products: how the biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar biologics are to be named, and whether pharmacist substitution is appropriate for products the FDA deems interchangeable. This article examines the current debate surrounding the use of nonproprietary names for biosimilar biologics, as well as state efforts to reconcile automatic substitution laws for the eventual products. In particular, the article addresses the implications for patients and the United States health care system, highlighting the potential negative effect on anticipated cost-savings, hindrances for effective tracking and reporting of adverse events, and a general lack of consistency in state laws.

Title: Long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis continuing on an etanercept biosimilar (LBEC0101) or switching from reference etanercept to LBEC0101: an open-label extension of a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study.
Publication Date: 2019-May-21
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31113455
Abstract: To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of continuing LBEC0101; the etanercept (ETN) biosimilar; or switching from the ETN reference product (RP) to LBEC0101 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
This multicentre, single-arm, open-label extension study enrolled patients who had completed a 52-week randomised, double-blind, parallel phase III trial of LBEC0101 vs ETN-RP. Patients treated with ETN-RP during the randomised controlled trial switched to LBEC0101; those treated with LBEC0101 continued to receive LBEC0101 in this study. LBEC0101 (50 mg) was administered subcutaneously once per week for 48 weeks with a stable dose of methotrexate. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of LBEC0101 were assessed up to week 100.
A total of 148 patients entered this extension study (70 in the maintenance group and 78 in the switch group). The 28-joint disease activity scores (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were maintained in both groups from week 52 to week 100 (from 3.068 to 3.103 in the maintenance group vs. from 3.161 to 3.079 in the switch group). ACR response rates at week 100 for the maintenance vs. switch groups were 79.7% vs. 83.3% for ACR20, 65.2% vs. 66.7% for ACR50 and 44.9% vs. 42.3% for ACR70. The incidence of adverse events and the proportion of patients with newly developed antidrug antibodies were similar in the maintenance and switch groups (70.0% and 70.5%, 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively).
Administration of LBEC0101 showed sustained efficacy and acceptable safety in patients with RA after continued therapy or after switching from ETN-RP to LBEC0101.

Abstract 456. Title: Post-marketing study of biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) to evaluate its safety and efficacy in Korea.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26395533
Abstract: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT-P13 (Remsima(®)) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in South Korea.
This post-marketing study included patients with active moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD), fistulizing CD (FCD), or moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with CT-P13 and followed for 30 weeks. Assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and disease-specific clinical response and remission.
No unexpected TEAEs were observed in the 173 patients recruited to date. TEAEs occurred in 18.1, 16.7, and 26.9% of CD, FCD, and UC patients, respectively. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 10% of patients and were mostly mild-moderate in severity. There were five serious TEAEs (two infusion-related reactions, two infections, one abdominal pain) and no cases of malignancy, pneumonia, or death. Positive outcomes for response/remission were reported regardless of whether patients had received prior infliximab or not.
CT-P13 was well tolerated and efficacious in patients with IBD.

Abstract 457. Title: Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Innovator Rituximab to Biosimilar CT-P10 Compared with Continued Treatment with CT-P10: Results of a 56-Week Open-Label Study in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28600696
Abstract: CT-P10 is a biosimilar candidate of innovator rituximab (RTX) that demonstrated a comparable clinical profile to RTX in a phase I randomized controlled trial (RCT) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01534884).
This open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT01873443) compared the efficacy and safety of CT-P10 in patients with RA who received CT-P10 from the outset (i.e., from the start of the RCT and also in the OLE; 'maintenance group') with those who received RTX during the RCT and switched to CT-P10 during the OLE ('switch group').
Patients who completed the RCT were recruited. Based on the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28) and predefined safety criteria, patients could receive up to two courses of CT-P10 during the OLE. Efficacy [DAS28 and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response], safety and immunogenicity were assessed.
Eighty-seven patients were enrolled; 58 and 29 had previously received CT-P10 or RTX, respectively, in the RCT. Of these, 38 (65.5%) and 20 (69.0%) were treated with CT-P10 in the OLE and therefore comprised the maintenance and switch groups, respectively. The mean change in DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) from baseline (week 0 of RCT) at week 24 of the first OLE treatment course in the maintenance and switch groups was -2.7 and -2.4, respectively. The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR responses was also comparable between groups. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 13.2 and 15.0% of patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, at week 24 of the first OLE course. CT-P10 treatment was well-tolerated when administered for up to 2 years or after switching from RTX.
In this study population, comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in patients who switched from RTX to CT-P10 and those maintained on CT-P10 throughout treatment.

Abstract 458. Title: Efficacy and safety of switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13 compared with maintenance of CT-P13 in ankylosing spondylitis: 102-week data from the PLANETAS extension study.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27117698
Abstract: To investigate the efficacy and safety of switching from infliximab reference product (RP) to its biosimilar or maintaining biosimilar treatment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
This open-label extension study recruited patients with AS who completed a 54-week, randomised controlled study comparing CT-P13 with RP (PLANETAS). CT-P13 (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 8 weeks from week 62 to week 102. Efficacy end points included the proportion of patients achieving Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20. Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were measured using an electrochemiluminescent method. Data were analysed for patients treated with CT-P13 in the main PLANETAS study and the extension (maintenance group) and those who were switched to CT-P13 during the extension study (switch group).
Overall, 174 (82.9%) of 210 patients who completed the first 54 weeks of PLANETAS and agreed to participate in the extension were enrolled. Among these, 88 were maintained on CT-P13 and 86 were switched to CT-P13 from RP. In these maintenance and switch groups, respectively, ASAS20 response rates at week 102 were 80.7% and 76.9%. ASAS40 and ASAS partial remission were also similar between groups. ADA positivity rates were comparable (week 102: 23.3% vs 27.4%). Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation during the extension study in 3 (3.3%) and 4 (4.8%) patients, respectively.
This is the first study to show that switching from RP to its biosimilar CT-P13 is possible without negative effects on safety or efficacy in patients with AS. In the maintenance group, CT-P13 was effective and well tolerated over 2 years of treatment.

Abstract 459. Title: Path of Interchangeability of Biosimilars in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Quality Before Cost Savings.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319603
Abstract: The advent of biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents an opportunity for cost-savings and increased patient access to effective disease-modifying therapies. While preliminary data in adult IBD and rheumatology patients suggest comparable effectiveness and pharmacokinetics between original biologics and biosimilars, long-term immunogenicity data are unknown. Without this data, conclusions about interchangeability should not be made for pediatric patients with IBD. Children affected by IBD, in particular, are a vulnerable group if automatic substitution and non-medical switching are allowed based on limited data in adult patients. Robust, long term immunogenicity data of biosimilars are needed in pediatric cohorts before policies allow interchangeability in children.

Abstract 460. Title: Cost-Effectiveness of Early Treatment with Originator Biologics or Their Biosimilars After Methotrexate Failure in Patients with Established Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148057
Abstract: Evidence supports the clinical benefits of early aggressive biologic treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), but the cost-effectiveness of early intervention with originator biologics such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or their biosimilars has not been well studied.
We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and utilities for patients with established RA who do not respond to methotrexate (MTX) therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing a standard intervention pathway (addition of originator biologic TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 12 months) and two early intervention pathways (either addition of originator biologic TNFis or addition of biosimilar TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 6 months).
Early intervention with an originator biologic TNFi at 6 months was associated with increases in total lifetime costs of £1692 and utilities of 0.10 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient compared with standard intervention at 12 months, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £17,335/QALY. Early intervention with a biosimilar TNFi increased costs by £70 and utilities by 0.10 QALYs per patient and was associated with an ICER of £713/QALY.
Switching from MTX monotherapy to combination therapy with either an originator biologic or biosimilar TNFis at 6 months after csDMARD failure in patients with RA was cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY.

Abstract 461. Title: Biologics and biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26105205
Abstract: Biological drugs are large, complex glycoprotein molecules produced in living organisms. Revolutionary treatments for many conditions, biologics used in dermatology will face patent expiration, opening opportunities for competitive versions. Biologic drugs are so complex such that it is impossible to reproduce them exactly. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar, though not identical, to the innovator product. Because biosimilars are not exact replicates of innovator biologics, guidelines have suggested that biosimilars should be considered as unique therapeutic interventions, requiring unique names and physician notification prior to substitution. However, because biologics can never be replicated exactly, even innovator biologics have inherent batch-to-batch variability; when the second batch of innovator products were released, physicians began prescribing non-identical variants of biologics to their patients, accepting the possibility of variation in clinical effects. Unlike the variants in innovator products, biosimilars will provide clinical trial data demonstrating similar clinical effects, though there will always be some degree of uncertainty in how much clinical impact will be result from the variation in both innovator and biosimilar products. How biosimilars are approved and how we use biosimilars will need to balance considerations of cost and development time with the possibility of variation in biological response.

Abstract 462. Title: Perspectives of Hospital Pharmacists Towards Biosimilar Medicines: A Survey of Polish Pharmacy Practice in General Hospitals.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30830647
Abstract: There has been a significant increase in the volume of biosimilar medicines recently due to the expiries of patent protections of biologic medicines. Biosimilars are considered new medicines, and their usage in therapy is often associated with uncertainty from the perspectives of physicians, pharmacists and patients.
The purpose of this study was to identify hospital pharmacist opinions towards these new medicines and investigate their usage in practice.
A paper-based, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to Polish hospital pharmacists.
Biosimilars were used in 77% of surveyed hospitals, whereas originator biologics were utilised within 90% of settings. The former medicines were found to consist of less than one-third of the entire course of biological pharmacotherapy used within Polish hospitals. A total of 88% of hospital pharmacists were concerned that the new drugs were not identical with the biologic versions, 48% with their immunogenicity and 44% with other pharmacokinetic properties. The majority of respondents (87%) stated that the most important advantage of biosimilars related to decreased costs. Furthermore, according to participants, pharmacist-led substitution is not appropriate.
Due to the numerous concerns relating to the usage of biosimilars, their introduction into patient therapy requires special attention from healthcare providers. While pharmacists involved in the distribution of biosimilars are conscious of their impact in decreasing costs of therapy, they do not feel comfortable in recommending their substitution without a physician's permission. There is a need for more precise legal regulations relating to biosimilars, improved communication between physicians and pharmacists, as well as educational initiatives to improve the safe and effective usage of biosimilars.

Abstract 463. Title: Biological therapy in pediatric age.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32783974
Abstract: Biological therapies, especially blocking tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) agents have radically changed the therapeutic approach and disease course of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In particular, drugs such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) have been demonstrated to be effective in inducing and maintaining corticosteroid-free remission in both adult and pediatric patients with Crohns Disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). Biosimilar biological (BioS) therapy is increasingly being used in pediatric age even though most knowledge on the safety and efficacy of these agents is based on IFX in adult IBD data. Studies show high rates of clinical response and remission in both IFX naïve patients and in patients switched from originator to BioS with similar risks of adverse events (AEs) as those reported with IFX originator. In the present review indications, efficacy and AEs of biological therapy in pediatric IBD will be discussed, as well as the role of other biological agents such as Golimumab, Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab, the role of BioS biological therapy and utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice.

Abstract 464. Title: Public Health Impact of Using Biosimilars, Is Automated Follow up Relevant?
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-29
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383867
Abstract: Biologic reference drugs and their copies, biosimilars, have a complex structure. Biosimilars need to demonstrate their biosimilarity during development but unpredictable variations can remain, such as micro-heterogeneity. The healthcare community may raise questions regarding the clinical outcomes induced by this micro-heterogeneity. Indeed, unwanted immune reactions may be induced for numerous reasons, including product variations. However, it is challenging to assess these unwanted immune reactions because of the multiplicity of causes and potential delays before any reaction. Moreover, safety assessments as part of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be of limited value with respect to immunogenicity assessments because they are performed on a standardised population during a limited period. Real-life data could therefore supplement the assessments of clinical trials by including data on the real-life use of biosimilars, such as switches. Furthermore, real-life data also include any economic incentives to prescribe or use biosimilars. This article raises the question of relevance of automating real life data processing regarding Biosimilars. The objective is to initiate a discussion about different approaches involving Machine Learning. So, the discussion is established regarding implementation of Neural Network model to ensure safety of biosimilars subject to economic incentives. Nevertheless, the application of Machine Learning in the healthcare field raises ethical, legal and technical issues that require further discussion.

Abstract 465. Title: The potential value of blood monitoring of biologic drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32095163
Abstract: The advent of biological therapies has been a major therapeutic advance in rheumatology. Many patients now enjoy improved quality of life through better disease control. The number of therapies continues to grow both within drug class (including biosimilar drugs) and <i>via</i> new mechanisms. For the first time, nonbiological drugs such as small-molecule inhibitors (Janus kinase inhibitors) have shown clinical equivalence. However, clinical unmet need remains with up to a third of patients commenced on a biologic therapy having minimal or no response: (a) Generally, the first biologic used secures the best response, with likelihood of remission falling thereafter with successive therapies; (b) the success of strategy trials using biological therapies can be difficult to replicate in clinical practice due to a combination of patient factors and service limitations. Accordingly, ensuring optimization of initial treatment is an important consideration before switching to alternatives. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the measurement of serum levels of a biologic drug with the aim of improving patient care. It is usually combined with detection of any antidrug antibodies that could neutralize the effect of the therapy. This technology has the potential to be a form of 'personalized medicine' by individualizing therapy, in particular, dosing and likelihood of sustained treatment response. It requires a clear relationship between drug dose, blood concentration and therapeutic effect. This paper will outline the technology behind TDM and unpack what we can learn from our colleagues in gastroenterology, where the adoption of TDM is at a more advanced stage than in rheumatology. It will explore and set out a number of clinical scenarios where rheumatologists might find TDM helpful in day-to-day practice. Finally, an outline is given of international developments, including regulatory body appraisals and guideline development.

Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30610544
Abstract: Background After the expiry of the patent of reference etanercept, several biosimilars have been developed, including SB4. Objective To study safety and efficacy of SB4 in psoriatic patients previously treated with etanercept and in the etanercept naive ones. Method Patients affected by moderate to severe psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis attending the Psoriasis Center of Florence University, treated with SB4 were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided in two cohorts. Cohort 1 included 32 patients who were switched from previous etanercept, cohort 2 included 12 patients who were naive to etanercept. Results Evaluation of the efficacy of SB4 in cohort 1 patients revealed rates of clinical remission (defined as both PASI and/or DAS28 increase < 10%) of 92% and 64% for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis respectively. In cohort 2 at week 24 PASI 75 was observed in 75% of patients. Conclusion In our experience switching from originator to SB4 in psoriatic patients seems not to influence efficacy, especially cutaneous manifestations, over a median observational period of 24 weeks.

Abstract 467. Title: BIOSIMILARS AND NEW INSULIN VERSIONS.
Publication Date: 2015-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26340139
Abstract: To provide clinicians with an overview of similar biologic products including biosimilars and new insulin versions available in the U.S. and of key issues associated with such products, including differences in manufacturing and regulatory approaches and their impact on clinical use.
We reviewed the relevant clinical and regulatory literature.
Patent protections for many biologics including several insulin preparations have or will expire shortly. This opens the door for new insulin versions to enter the U.S. and global marketplace. The development, manufacturing, and approval process for similar biologic products is more complex than for generic versions of small molecules. Most similar biologic products in the U.S. will be submitted for approval under section 351(k), a newly created biosimilar regulatory pathway. However, some biologics, including new insulin versions, will be submitted via the existing 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. These regulatory pathways have implications for how such products may be labeled, how they may be dispensed, and how patients may perceive them. The immunogenicity of biologics can affect safety and efficacy and can be altered through subtle changes in manufacturing. With the arrival of new insulin versions, health care providers will need to understand the implications of interchangeability, therapeutic equivalence, substitution, switching, and new delivery devices.
An understanding of the above topics will be important as physicians, payers, and patients choose between similar versions of a reference listed biologic product.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33669641
Abstract: The effect of switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab in patients with sarcoidosis is unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of switching from Remicade<sup>®</sup> or Inflectra<sup>®</sup> to Flixabi<sup>®</sup> in patients with severe refractory sarcoidosis. This single center retrospective cohort study was performed at St Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein, The Netherlands. All patients diagnosed with severe refractory sarcoidosis receiving Remicade<sup>®</sup> or Inflectra<sup>®</sup> switched to Flixabi<sup>®</sup>. The primary outcome was infliximab discontinuation within 6 months of switching. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and loss of clinical, functional, or inflammatory response. Out of 86 patients who switched to Flixabi<sup>®</sup>, 79 patients had complete data. None of the 79 patients discontinued infliximab during the first 6 months after switching. Five patients reported an adverse event related to Flixabi<sup>®</sup> treatment. We found no change from baseline in FVC, FEV1, DLCOc, 6MWT, and infliximab trough levels 26 weeks after switching. An improvement in physical functioning of 7.3 ± 13.4 points (<i>p</i> = 0.002) with RAND/SF36 and in biomarker sIL-2R (-475.58 ± 1452.39; <i>p</i> = 0.005) was observed. Switching from originator infliximab Remicade<sup>®</sup> or biosimilar infliximab Inflectra<sup>®</sup> to biosimilar infliximab Flixabi<sup>®</sup> did not result in treatment discontinuation or loss of clinical/functional/inflammatory remission.

Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718934
Abstract: Patients' perspectives after switching from infliximab to a biosimilar have yet to be assessed.
To assess patients' perspectives in a prospective manner after switching from infliximab to CT-P13.
113 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on maintenance therapy with infliximab were switched to CT-P13. Patients' perspectives were assessed by questionnaires, including the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and FACIT-F (questionnaire regarding fatigue), and patient-reported outcomes (IBD disability index) at the inclusion and after the fourth CT-P13 infusion.
After one year, the patients' perspectives did not change after the switch according to BMQ-general, BMQ-specific necessity and BMQ-specific concerns subscales. No difference was observed in the mean IBD-DI score, while a significant improvement in fatigue was observed according to the FACIT-F questionnaire. Patients' concerns were raised about the use of biosimilars and the risks of switching with a significant improvement after switching (65% vs. 42%, respectively, p = 0.01). Fourteen (12.4%) patients experienced loss of response to CT-P13, including 12 with restoration of steroid-free clinical remission after CT-P13 dose optimization.
Although some concerns were reported, no difference was observed in patients' perspectives after switching from infliximab to CT-P13.

Abstract 471. Title: Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Early Compared with Late or No Biologic Treatment to Manage Crohn's Disease using Real-World Data.
Publication Date: 2020-May-21
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31630164
Abstract: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early [≤2 years after diagnosis] compared with late or no biologic initiation [starting biologics >2 years after diagnosis or no biologic use] for adults with Crohn's disease in Switzerland.
We developed a Markov cohort model over the patient's lifetime, from the health system and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real-world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early [intervention] and late/no [comparator] biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained is reported in Swiss francs [CHF]. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.
Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention [CHF384 607; 16.84 QALYs] compared with the comparator [CHF340 800; 16.75 QALYs] strategy, resulting in high ICERs [health system: CHF887 450 per QALY; societal: CHF449 130 per QALY]. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, assuming a threshold of CHF100 000 per QALY, the probability that the intervention strategy was cost-effective was 0.1 and 0.25 from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices [health system: CHF134 502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant].
Early biologic use was not cost-effective, considering a threshold of CHF100 000 per QALY compared with late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.

Abstract 472. Title: Real-World Evaluation of Dosing in Patients Converted From Insulin Glargine (Lantus) to Insulin Glargine (Basaglar).
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32037850
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Basaglar, insulin glargine (BGlar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a follow-on biologic, was developed after the patent for Lantus, insulin glargine (LGlar; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) expired. <b>Objective:</b> To compare the dosing and hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> (A1C)-lowering effects of BGlar compared with LGlar in a real-world setting. <b>Methods:</b> Adult patients, at 5 clinics, with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were converted from LGlar to BGlar were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome compared mean basal insulin dose (U/d) from the date of conversion to 6 months. Basal insulin and total daily insulin doses were also compared from baseline to 3- and 12-months postconversion, as also change in A1C, body weight, and estimated monthly acquisition costs of basal insulin. <b>Results:</b> Of the 225 patients included, 56% were male, and 81% had T2DM. The mean conversion dose (U/d) of LGlar was 46.3 ± 32.7. There was no significant difference in the mean BGlar dose (U/d) at 6 months (45.9 ± 33.5; <i>P</i> = 0.52), nor was there a statistical difference at 3 or 12 months. There were no significant differences in change in A1C at any time point. The estimated monthly acquisition cost of BGlar was significantly less than that for LGlar at conversion ($286 vs $341, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and 6 months ($290 vs $351, <i>P</i> < 0.001) respectively. <b>Conclusion/Relevance:</b> The results of this retrospective study suggest that BGlar resulted in similar glycemic outcomes compared with LGlar in a real-world setting and may be a preferable option in a value-based health care environment.

Abstract 473. Title: Challenges in the implementation of trastuzumab biosimilars: an expert panel's recommendations.
Publication Date: 2015-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26352219
Abstract: Trastuzumab has transformed the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Because of impending European patent expiry in 2017, numerous trastuzumab biosimilars are currently undergoing comparability exercises for marketing authorization. Although biosimilar products have been approved in Europe since 2006, many obstacles are expected for trastuzumab, resulting from its nature as a monoclonal antibody, its impact on overall survival, and its extensive biochemical complexities. Unsolved questions need to be addressed for the evaluation of biosimilars' activity in terms of appropriate clinical endpoint definitions for such anticancer drugs, specific assessment pathways and comparative testing of biosimilars, untested ensuing de facto combination of trastuzumab biosimilars with cytotoxics, and immunogenicity monitoring among immunocompromised patients. In such a context of uncertainties, the recent approval by the French parliament of biosimilar substitution, which would allow dispensing trastuzumab biosimilars in place of the originator, should interrogate the oncological community. A think tank of experts was created to delineate specificities and challenges stemming from trastuzumab biosimilars.

Abstract 474. Title: Implementation of CT-P13 via a Managed Switch Programme in Crohn's Disease: 12-Month Real-World Outcomes.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535885
Abstract: Switching from Remicade to CT-P13 allows for significant cost savings and has been shown to be non-inferior to continued therapy with Remicade for the treatment of Crohn's disease.
The aim of this work was to prospectively evaluate clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease switching from Remicade to CT-P13.
A prospective service evaluation was performed. The Harvey-Bradshaw index, CRP, faecal calprotectin and serum for infliximab/antibody levels were collected prior to patients' final Remicade infusion and at 6 and 12 months after switching to CT-P13 as part of routine clinical care. All adverse events during follow-up were also recorded.
One hundred and ten patients on Remicade switched to CT-P13. No significant difference was observed between the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (p = 0.07), CRP (p = 0.13), faecal calprotectin (p = 0.25) or trough infliximab levels (p = 0.47) comparing before and at 6 and 12 months after the switch to CT-P13. Seven patients developed new infliximab antibodies after switching from Remicade to CT-P13. The majority of patients remained on CT-P13 at 12 months (84.5%) and the rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was 53.8 and 13.5 per 100 patient-years of follow-up, respectively. Switching to CT-P13 resulted in a cost saving of approximately 46.4%.
The transition to CT-P13 from Remicade for the treatment of Crohn's disease is safe and has no negative effect on clinical outcomes at 12 months.

Abstract 475. Title: Treat-to-target strategy with secukinumab as a first-line biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug compared to standard-of-care treatment in patients with active axial spondyloarthritis: protocol for a randomised open-label phase III study, AScalate.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-30
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32998926
Abstract: In patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are recommended to those with inadequate response or contraindications to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In case of failure of the first bDMARD, a switch within the class or to other bDMARD is recommended. Despite these treatment options, there is no optimal treat-to-target (T2T) strategy. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a T2T strategy in patients with axSpA, with secukinumab as a first-line bDMARD, compared with standard-of-care (SOC) treatment.
This is a randomised, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre ongoing study in patients with axSpA who are naïve to bDMARD and who have had an inadequate response to NSAIDs. The study will include an 8-week screening period, a 36-week treatment period and a 20-week safety follow-up period. At baseline, patients will be randomised (1:1) to T2T or SOC group. In the T2T group, patients will be treated with secukinumab 150 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) weekly until week 4 and then at week 8. For non-responders (patients without Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] clinically important improvement; change from baseline ≥1.1) at week 12, dose will be escalated to 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks until week 24. Non-responders at week 24 will be switched to adalimumab biosimilar 40 mg s.c. every 2 weeks until week 34. In the SOC group, patients will receive treatment at the discretion of the physician. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving an Assessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society 40% (ASAS40) response at week 24.
The study is being conducted as per the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and after approval from independent ethics committees/institutional review boards. The first results are expected to be published in early 2022.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03906136.

Abstract 476. Title: The advent of biosimilars for the treatment of diabetes: current status and future directions.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25990669
Abstract: Biosimilar insulins are likely to enter the market of diabetes therapies as patents for major branded insulin products start to expire in the next few years (on June 2014, the European Medicines Agency authorized the first biosimilar of insulin glargine, Abasria, 100 Units/ml, for the treatment of diabetes mellitus). This would allow providing comparable clinical benefits of the current available insulins at a significantly lower cost, thus increasing the affordability and access of insulin treatment for patients with diabetes. Biosimilars are approved via a stringent regulatory pathway demonstrating quality, safety, and efficacy comparable to the reference product. However, the production complexities of such products raise important considerations for treatment efficacy and patient safety, including naming and product tracking, substitution practices, and pharmacovigilance. Additionally, as practitioners' knowledge regarding the differences about pharmacological, clinical, and regulatory aspects between biosimilars and generic small molecules is often suboptimal, specific education on biosimilar prescribing, dispensing, and administering is critical for ensuring patients' benefit and safety. This article discusses all the issues concerning biosimilar, especially biosimilar insulins.

Abstract 477. Title: Reconstructing the dynamics of HIV evolution within hosts from serial deep sequence data.
Publication Date: 2012-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23133358
Abstract: At the early stage of infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 predominantly uses the CCR5 coreceptor for host cell entry. The subsequent emergence of HIV variants that use the CXCR4 coreceptor in roughly half of all infections is associated with an accelerated decline of CD4+ T-cells and rate of progression to AIDS. The presence of a 'fitness valley' separating CCR5- and CXCR4-using genotypes is postulated to be a biological determinant of whether the HIV coreceptor switch occurs. Using phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within hosts enables us to discriminate between competing models of this process. We have developed a phylogenetic pipeline for the molecular clock analysis, ancestral reconstruction, and visualization of deep sequence data. These data were generated by next-generation sequencing of HIV RNA extracted from longitudinal serum samples (median 7 time points) from 8 untreated subjects with chronic HIV infections (Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection and AIDS). We used the known dates of sampling to directly estimate rates of evolution and to map ancestral mutations to a reconstructed timeline in units of days. HIV coreceptor usage was predicted from reconstructed ancestral sequences using the geno2pheno algorithm. We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months. CXCR4 usage arose in multiple lineages within 5 of 8 subjects, and ancestral lineages following alternate mutational pathways before going extinct were common. We observed highly patient-specific distributions and time-scales of mutation accumulation, implying that the role of a fitness valley is contingent on the genotype of the transmitted variant.

Abstract 478. Title: Biologicals and biosimilars: safety issues in Europe.
Publication Date: 2017-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28540760
Abstract: Medicinal products of a biological origin are approved by the EMA at a centralized level. However, there is no harmonization about their use in Europe. The current regulation referring to the safety of biological medicinal products and biosimilars in Europe has been identified. The safety associated with medicinal products of a biological origin is assured by the pharmacovigilance system, which has evolved, but doesn't yet incorporate all of the specific information from this market segment, namely that related to the identification of drugs, and its use - including the prescription and dispensing, given the possibility of interchangeability and substitution. The terminology, information systems and traceability systems aren't entirely appropriate to ensure the safety requirements for therapy with medicinal products of a biological origin. Areas covered: This article aims to identify the prescription and dispensing profiles of reference biological medicines and biosimilars in the EU, and the determinants that support their safe use. Expert opinion: The European pharmacovigilance system must evolve to ensure the safety along all of the biologicals' therapeutic cycle. It must consider the safety for each of the medicines in addition to their safety pattern related to the eventual switching procedure.

Abstract 479. Title: The nocebo effect: a clinical challenge in the era of biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30118338
Abstract: The nocebo effect is defined as a negative effect of a pharmacological or non-pharmacological medical treatment that is induced by patients' expectations, and that is unrelated to the physiological action of the treatment. The nocebo effect is an important clinical challenge in the current era of biosimilars. Areas covered: This review aims to answer five key questions about the nocebo effect, namely to reveal its definition, pathophysiology, clinical relevance, contributing factors, and management. Expert commentary: The nocebo effect lowers patients' quality of life and negatively affects treatment adherence rates in biosimilar-treated patients. It may negatively impact on the cost-savings of biosimilars. Health-care providers in charge of biosimilar-treated patients need to be aware of the nocebo effect and adopt strategies to minimize it. They have to be well-informed and confident about the existing evidence about biosimilars. A good patient-physician relationship will improve patients' acceptance of biosimilars, and limits the risk of inappropriate negative bias and the nocebo effect.

Abstract 480. Title: Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in psoriasis: addressing key challenges using biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32886008
Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are key treatment options in moderate-severe psoriasis. The advent of multiple biosimilars of these drugs provides a major opportunity to address this particular factor by helping to reduce costs. Reduced cost can help improve undertreatment, which is one of the challenges in treating moderate-severe psoriasis. There is now a wealth of real-world evidence demonstrating that patients with psoriasis can be initiated on - or transitioned to - an anti-TNF biosimilar without detrimental effects on overall safety and efficacy. Furthermore, recent results suggest that patients can be switched between different biosimilar versions of the same anti-TNF agent without any compromise in outcomes.
In this review, we summarized the role of anti-TNFs in psoriasis, health economic aspects of anti-TNF biosimilars, and their real-world data in clinical practice and registries.
The introduction and competition of anti-TNF biosimilars reduced the cost of biologics and accumulated real-world data support efficacy and safety of anti-TNF biosimilars for psoriasis treatment. Although IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors show better efficacy in psoriasis patients, long-term efficacy and safety data of anti-TNF and cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF biosimilars may play an important role to increase patient access to biologics through greater adoption of biosimilars.

Abstract 481. Title: Switching from IFX originator to biosimilar CT-P13 does not impact effectiveness,safety and immunogenicity in a large cohort of IBD patients.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074723
Abstract: Switching from IFX originator to CT-P13 is safe; however, little data on immunogenicity exists.
Consecutive IBD patients on IFX originator were switched to CT-P13 and followed-up for 12 months. Clinical activity, infliximab trough levels (ITLs), anti-drug antibodies (ATIs), and adverse events were recorded at predefined timepoints (baseline, second CT-P13 infusion, 6 and 12 months). The outcomes investigated were immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety.
119 patients were switched to CT-P13 after a median time with IFX of 5.8 years. No changes in mean ITLs were observed. ATIs were detected in 30 patients (25.2%): 14 before and 16 after switch. Mean persistent ATIs were significantly higher compared to mean transient ones (109.74 ng/mL ±84.70 vs 18.22 ng/mL ±11.37, p < 0.001), with significantly lower ITLs associated (mean 0.32 µg/mL ±0.6 vs 3.08 µg/mL ±3.22, p < 0.001). A significant decrease of patients in steroid-fee clinical remission was observed after the switch (p = 0.004), with subsequent improvement at 6 months (p = 0.005). Eighteen patients (15.1%) discontinued IFX, only 6 (5%) for loss of response.
Switching from infliximab originator to CT-P13 seems safe and effective, without differences in immunogenicity. A temporary reduction of clinical benefit after switching could be potentially explained by a 'nocebo-effect response'.

Abstract: The first biosimilar version of a biologic agent used to treat psoriasis (infliximab) entered the Spanish market on February 16 of this year, and more biosimilars can be expected to follow in the coming months and years. Logically, this new situation will have economic repercussions and alter prescribing patterns among dermatologists. In this article, we review regulatory issues related to the approval of biosimilars, with a particular focus on the situation in the European Union. We will examine analytical characterization studies and special considerations for clinical trials with biosimilars, and also look at several somewhat contentious issues, such as the extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, and automatic substitution. Finally, we will review the biosimilars with indications for psoriasis currently in the clinical development pipeline and assess their potential to offer comparable efficacy and safety to the reference product while contributing to the sustainability of the public health care system.

Abstract 484. Title: Biosimilars for the treatment of psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31237786
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Biosimilars are biological products that are very similar to their originators, with no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and purity. Since the patents of some of the biologics used to treat patients with psoriasis have expired, uptake of biosimilars provides a good opportunity to reduce the cost of treatment. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this review we summarize the stages in development of a biosimilar product, the main differences with the originator biologic, and their potential implications. We have also reviewed clinical trials of biosimilars approved for the treatment of psoriasis. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Because of efficacy and convenience of administration, adalimumab biosimilars will be used to greater extent than etanercept or infliximab to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of approved biosimilars are equivalent to those of their reference products in clinical trials, and multiple-switch studies are intended to provide evidence in support of FDA-required interchangeability. Non-medical switching is expected to become frequent, and the nocebo effect will be relevant. Traceability of biologics is an essential requirement to gather relevant information on their long-term efficacy and safety, especially when multiple switches occur.

Abstract 485. Title: DISCONTINUATION RATES FOLLOWING A SWITCH FROM A REFERENCE TO A BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGIC IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32935741
Abstract: Biologics have revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, these drugs had a significant influence on treatment-related costs, which resulted in the development of biosimilars.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the drug discontinuation rate in the IBD population who switched from originator to biosimilars in real-world switching studies and address potential nocebo effects as reasons for drug discontinuation.
Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and abstract databases of selected congresses were screened for reports of monoclonal antibody (mAb) switching with a minimum post-switch follow-up of >6 months or three infusions. All available information on discontinuation rates was assessed.
A total of 30 observational studies were included, involving 3,594 patients with IBD. Twenty-six studies reported a switch from infliximab to CT-P13, two studies involved a switch to SB2, and switching information was not available in two studies. The discontinuation rates were 8%, 14%, and 21% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The main reasons for drug discontinuation and their respective risks were: disease worsening (2%), remission (4%), loss of adherence (4%), adverse events (5%), and loss of response (7%). The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low depending on the outcome analyzed. Subjective symptoms leading to drug discontinuation were infrequently reported, and the nocebo effect was clearly assessed in just one of the included papers.
Discontinuation rates following a switch to a biosimilar in patients with IBD increase over time. However, it was not possible to confirm the nocebo effect as a reason for discontinuation. Therefore, long-term studies evaluating the use of biosimilars to monitor adverse events and potential nocebo effects in post-marketing surveillance are still needed.

Abstract 486. Title: Infliximab Biosimilars in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28035633
Abstract: Biological therapies represent a fundamental innovation for the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, many biological originators have reached, or are about to reach, patent expiry and long-term therapy costs have become progressively unsustainable. CT-P13, a biosimilar of the anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibody infliximab, might represent a significant alternative to its originator, with the potential to decrease medical care costs and, therefore, become available to a large number of patients.
In this systematic review, we analyzed the data from available clinical trials that recently investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD in naïve patients and in patients who switched from its originator infliximab, focusing on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.
A detailed literature search was developed a priori to identify articles that investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD in TNF inhibitor treatment-naïve patients and in patients who switched from the originator infliximab. This was applied to Ovid MEDLINE, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for content from 2012 to September 2016.
We based our review on the available data from 11 studies that included a total of 1007 IBD patients: 570 patients suffering from Crohn's disease (294 switched and 276 naïve), 435 patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (127 switched and 308 naïve), and two IBD unclassified patients (switched). Overall, no significant difference in efficacy and safety between the originator infliximab and its biosimilar CT-P13 was observed. When assessing the safety of CT-P13, we found that 9.2% of patients experienced adverse effects (4.1% infusion-related reactions and 4.3% infections).
The analyzed studies did not report a significant difference in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity when comparing the clinical experience with CT-P13 with the available literature data on the originator treatment in IBD. However, some debate is ongoing regarding interchangeability and immunogenicity.

Abstract 487. Title: Quality, Non-clinical and Clinical Considerations for Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibody Development: EU, WHO, USA, Canada, and BRICS-TM Regulatory Guidelines.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30364154
Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> The aim was to critically evaluate well-established regulatory agencies mAb biosimilar guidelines for development and marketing authorization about quality, efficacy and safety and compare to BRICS-TM regulations to identify challenges. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The current valid guidelines of EMA, WHO, USFDA, BGTD/HC, ICH, and BRICS-TM were obtained from official websites and comparative qualitative review was performed. <b>Results:</b> The review revealed that Health Canada uses mAb specific guidelines from EMA or USFDA when necessary. The BRICS agencies (except Russia) have incorporated some or most of the WHO SBP TRS and related annexes in similar national biotechnological/biological guidelines; however, gaps or insufficient information have been identified. The Russian Federation has issued general product registration guideline/s with very brief information about mAbs. The TMMDA (Turkey) has published an updated biosimilar guideline which parallels those of the EMA and the ones from WHO; however, no mAb specific guidelines are published. COFEPRIS (Mexico) has published a biotechnological/biological product registration guideline with no information about mAb. The SAHPRA biosimilar guideline has an annex on mAbs which focuses on non-clinical and clinical aspects. The comparative evaluation of BRICS-TM agencies indicates a gap pertaining to clarification for physico-chemical characterization, manufacturing process, overages and compatibility requirements between biological substances and excipients specifically on mAbs. <i>In vitro</i> assay requirements seem quite aligned with those of WHO, whereas <i>in vivo</i> studies mostly have disparity in terms of necessity, type of studies as well as design and criteria. Clinical safety and efficacy studies are indicated in emerging regulatory agencies, however detailed information pertaining to design, size of populations, requirements for primary and secondary endpoints, clarity and evaluation criteria differ. In general, BRICS-TM agencies allow extrapolation of indications provided that pre-defined conditions are met. Interchangeability, switching and substitution of biosimilars are not defined in most of BRIC-TM guidelines whereas South Africa, by law, allows neither interchangeability nor substitution. Pediatric research remains questionable across BRICS-TM. <b>Conclusions:</b> EMA, USFDA guidelines are broadly aligned with WHO and in addition, they also contain specific requirements pertaining to their own region. BRICS-TM has considerably less defined mAb specific biosimilar development and comparability parameters in their published guidelines.

Abstract 488. Title: Biosimilars in oncology: from development to clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2014-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24767633
Abstract: Biologics play an integral role in the treatment of cancer not only for their therapeutic effects and ability to improve outcomes, but also as supportive care agents. Biologics are more complex to manufacture and take longer to bring to market. Because biologics are considerably more costly than small-molecule drugs, their use has placed an increasing economic demand on healthcare systems worldwide. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar to existing branded biologics, but because biologics cannot be exactly copied, biosimilars should not be referred to as generic, exact versions of the innovator biologic. Biosimilars have the potential to increase access and provide lower cost options for cancer care as patent protection for some of the most widely used biologics begins to expire. Regulatory requirements for biosimilars are evolving, as are global harmonization and/or standardization strategies that can facilitate their robust clinical development. This review highlights critical factors involved with the integration of biosimilars into oncology treatment paradigms and practices. Clinicians will likely seek out practice guidelines and position statements from established scientific societies to help evaluate key information regarding biosimilars, such as efficacy, safety, comparability, and interchangeability with the reference biologic. Automatic substitution, nomenclature, extrapolation of clinical data from one indication to another, as well as parameters for ongoing pharmacovigilance are evolving considerations. Education of physicians and other healthcare providers, payers, and patients about biosimilars may facilitate informed decision making, promote acceptance of biosimilars into clinical practice, increase accessibility, and expedite associated health and economic benefits.

Abstract 489. Title: The global landscape on interchangeability of biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2022-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33567923
Abstract: Biosimilars hold the potential to be an integral healthcare component that can significantly improve affordability and thereby accessibility of the otherwise expensive biotherapeutic products. Regulators, payors, and policymakers, each have a major role to play in successful adoption of biosimilars. One of the issues that has been a point of frequent discussion is that of interchangeability of biosimilars.
This article aims to review the position that the major regulatory bodies have taken on interchangeability of biosimilars. Key issues that remain are also discussed. Adalimumab and etanercept have been chosen as real-world case studies to demonstrate interchangeability considerations. The need for gaining global harmonization on interchangeability is highlighted.
A global harmonization on the interchangeability can likely accelerate biosimilar adoption and result in better accessibility to biologics. Experience gained with real-world studies supports switching to biosimilars from originators however post-marketing pharmacovigilance should be in place to assess the risk-benefit profile of biosimilars in the long run.

Abstract 490. Title: Biosimilar safety factors in clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26058551
Abstract: This article provides insight into the guidelines issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the draft guidances issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding potential safety considerations associated with the development and use of biosimilars.
EMA and FDA guidelines and the literature were reviewed to identify recommendations and experience of manufacturers regarding the safety of biosimilars.
Recent results of phase 3 comparability clinical trials comparing biosimilars with their reference products, and the approval of a biosimilar infliximab by several regulatory agencies, demonstrate the growing importance of biosimilars in inflammatory diseases. The safety profiles of biosimilars developed according to regulatory guidelines appear to be highly similar to the reference product, and postmarketing pharmacovigilance programs are in place. Additional topics related to biosimilars, such as interchangeability, automatic substitution, and nomenclature, are discussed.
Safety considerations in the development of biosimilars are an important focus of regulatory guidelines, although topics such as interchangeability, automatic substitution, and nomenclature are still being debated.

Abstract: This study aimed to provide an overview of biosimilar policies in 10 EU MSs. <b>Methods</b>: Ten EU MS pharmaceutical markets (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) were selected. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify supply-side and demand-side policies in place in the selected countries. <b>Results</b>: Supply-side policies for biosimilars commonly include price linkage, price re-evaluation, and tendering; the use of internal or external reference pricing varies between countries; health technology assessment is conducted in six countries. Regarding demand-side policies, pharmaceutical prescription budgets or quotas and monitoring of prescriptions (with potential financial incentives or penalties) are in place in eight and in seven countries respectively. Switching is generally allowed, but is solely the physician's responsibility. Automatic substitution is not recommended, or even forbidden, in most EU MSs. Prescription conditions or guidelines that apply to biosimilars are established in nearly all surveyed EU MSs. <b>Conclusions</b>: Important heterogeneity in policies on biosimilars was seen between (and even within) selected countries, which may partly explain variations in biosimilar uptake. Supply-side policies targeting price have been reported to limit biosimilar penetration in the long term, despite short-term savings, while demand-side policies are considered to positively impact uptake.

Abstract 492. Title: Same but different? A thematic analysis on adalimumab biosimilar switching among patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-04
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31585539
Abstract: Biologic medications have dramatically enhanced the treatment of many chronic paediatric inflammatory conditions. Their high cost is a factor that prohibits their broader use. Cheaper generic versions, or biosimilars, are increasingly being used. Healthcare services are switching some patients over to biosimilars for economic reasons, known as 'non-medical switching'. Some patients unsuccessfully switch due to perceived decreases in efficacy or non-specific drug effects. The implications of failed switching include exhaustion of therapeutic options, unnecessary exposure to other medications, increased healthcare utilisation, worse patient outcomes and higher overall healthcare costs. Patient perceptions almost certainly play a role in these 'failed switches'.
A thematic analysis was performed to better understand patient and parent perceptions on non-medical biosimilar switching. The study was conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research recommendations. Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis currently taking adalimumab were included.
Nine families were interviewed just prior to a hospital trust-wide non-medical switch to an adalimumab biosimilar. Several common themes were identified. The most frequent concerns were regarding practical aspects of the switch including the medication administration device type; the colour of the medication and administration device; and whether the injections would sting more. The relative safety and efficacy of the biosimilar was raised although most families felt that there would be no significant difference. Anxieties about the switch were largely placated by reassurances from the medical team.
We derived recommendations based on existing adult literature and the observations from our study to optimise the benefits from non-medical biosimilar switching.

Abstract 493. Title: Postmarket policy considerations for biosimilar oncology drugs.
Publication Date: 2016-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26758759
Abstract: Oncology biological products are some of the most expensive drugs on the market and are a growing financial burden on patients and health-care systems. By 2020, numerous major biological cancer drugs will lose their patent protection allowing follow-on competitors, known as biosimilars, to enter the market. Clinical and regulatory considerations for biosimilars have begun to harmonise in Europe and the USA to help to define and streamline the pathway for biosimilar market authorisation. Yet, substantial international variation still exists in the pricing and market uptake of approved biosimilar oncology drugs. Differences in national postmarket policies for biosimilars might explain these disparities in pricing and uptake. In this Policy Review, policy approaches to competition between biosimilars and originators used by seven European countries--Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK--and the USA are discussed, chosen because these countries represent a variety of postmarket policies and build on conclusions from previous work. We discuss these policies within the context of interchangeability, physician prescribing, substitutability, pharmacist dispensing, hospital financing and tendering, and pricing.

Abstract 494. Title: Prevalence of switching from two anti-TNF biosimilars back to biologic reference products in Germany.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30990409
Abstract: Biosimilars are becoming more and more important for the treatment of many diseases. However, it is not understood how they are tolerated. Our aim was to analyze the behavior of switching from two anti-TNF biosimilars back to biologic reference products in German patients.
Patients switching from etanercept reference to an etanercept biosimilar between February 2016 and December 2017 and those switching from the infliximab reference product to an infliximab biosimilar between February 2015 and December 2017 were included in the study (index date). The main outcome of this study, the rate of switching from these two biosimilars back to reference products, was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to predict the switch-back behavior.
A total of 2,956 patients were included in this study. After 3 months, 14.7% and, after 12 months, 30.2% of them were switched back from a biosimilar to the reference product. Sex, age, physician specialty, and co-therapy were not significantly associated with this switch.
Almost one third of the patients treated with one of two biosimilar drugs after previous biologic therapy are switched back to reference products in Germany.

Abstract 495. Title: Are biosimilars approved for use in psoriasis safe enough to replace leading biologic therapies? A review.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32116071
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Many tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 'biosimilar' agents have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoinflammatory conditions. These biosimilars have the same structure as the originator biologic and have been shown to be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. However, given the method by which biosimilars are manufactured, they are not exact replicas of the originator, unlike generic forms of non-biologic medications. Therefore, there is controversy regarding whether these agents should be considered interchangeable with their originator biologics.<b>Areas covered</b>: The objective of this review is to summarize the safety data for each of the approved TNF-alpha biosimilars to determine whether or not these agents have appropriate safety profiles to replace their originator biologics.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Based on extrapolation of phase III investigations in patients with rheumatologic diseases, each of the approved anti-TNF agents have comparable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles to their originators. Studies in patients with psoriasis are more limited. Transitioning from a biologic to its biosimilar has also been shown to be similarly safe and immunogenetic compared to maintenance therapy with the originator. More post-marketing studies are needed to demonstrate the long-term safety in patients with psoriasis.

Abstract 496. Title: Safety and Effectiveness of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Biosimilar Agents in the Treatment of Psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32048187
Abstract: Biologic drugs have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. In recent years, many tumor necrosis factor-alpha 'biosimilar' agents have been developed. These biosimilars are similar in structure and function to their originator molecules, although they are not identical. Given that the safety and efficacy of the original biologic have already been proven, biosimilars are only required to show bioequivalence, or non-inferiority, to the reference biologic to be approved. Based on extrapolation of these non-inferiority data, biosimilars may be subsequently approved for all indications of the originator biologic, even without being directly studied in these various conditions. These biosimilar agents have been purported as a method to reduce the costs of biologic therapies, thereby increasing the accessibility of these medications and subsequently improving the treatment of psoriasis worldwide. The US Food and Drug Administration and/or the European Medicines Agency have approved biosimilars of adalimumab (Amjevita/Amgevita/Solymbic, Cyltezo, Imraldi/Hadlima, Hyrimoz/Hefiya/Halimatoz, Idacio, Hulio, Abrilada), etanercept (Erelzi, Benepali/Eticovo), and infliximab (Inflectra/Remsima, Renflexis/Flixabi, Ixifi/Zessly) for the treatment of psoriasis, and others are under review. There are many phase III data supporting the bioequivalence of these anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha biosimilar agents in treating psoriasis and rheumatologic disease, which are discussed here. In general, these biosimilar agents have been shown to have equivalent efficacy, tolerability, and immunogenicity profiles compared to their originators in patients with rheumatologic disease, although studies in patients with psoriasis are fairly limited. Additional switching studies and post-marketing safety analyses are needed to assess the interchangeability of biosimilar agents with their reference products.

Abstract 497. Title: To See or NOsee: The Debate on the Nocebo Effect and Optimizing the Use of Biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29873005
Abstract: In addition to the general clinical benefit offered, biosimilars may not only generate savings for healthcare budgets but also improve patient access to biologic products. Since the first biosimilar was approved in Europe in 2006, a further 36 different biosimilar drugs have been approved for several indications. Despite the wealth of experience gained and the reported data supporting the use of biosimilars, both in naïve and biologic-experienced patients, some healthcare professionals continue to express doubt regarding the rigorous approval process for biosimilars and uncertainty with how to incorporate them into daily clinical practice. These opinions can be transferred to patients through poor or lack of communication, meaning that patients may lack confidence in treatment quality and, as a result, be susceptible to the nocebo effect. At the 2017 American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals annual meeting, during a debate the question was asked as to whether the nocebo effect was in fact being used to describe "any result you don't agree with". Here, we detail that the nocebo effect has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials, and that this effect may negatively affect acceptance in patients switching from an originator product to a biosimilar. Awareness of the potential for the nocebo effect and adoption of enhanced communication techniques may be useful in mitigating the nocebo effect. Effective healthcare professional-patient dialogue is key in transferring confidence to the patient, and has been shown to reduce nocebo effects in patients when switching from an originator to a biosimilar.

Abstract 498. Title: Effectiveness and safety of adalimumab biosimilar ABP 501 in Crohn's disease: an observational study.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32054272
Abstract: there are no studies in the literature about the effectiveness of adalimumab biosimilar ABP 501 in Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate its effectiveness and safety.
an observational study was performed in Crohn's disease patients treated with ABP 501, with the classic induction and maintenance regimen and in Crohn's disease patients who were switched from the adalimumab originator to ABP 501.
eighty-seven patients were included in the study, of which 25 were naïve to the adalimumab originator and 62 were switched to ABP 501. In adalimumab-naïve patients, clinical response at three months was 60% (15/25) and clinical remission at three months was 56% (14/25). At six months, 95.2% (59/62) of the patients switched to ABP 501 were still in therapy, without a significant increase of clinical activity (Harvey-Bradshaw index from 3.4, 95% CI = 2.4-4.4, to 3.8, 95% CI = 2.7-4.9, p = 0.23) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein from 4.2 mg/l, 95% CI = 2.5-5.9 mg/l, to 3.6 mg/l, 95% CI = 2.2-5 mg/l, p = 0.32). There were no unexpected adverse events during the study period.
our results support ABP 501 as an effective and well-tolerated drug, with a good interchangeability with its originator for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

Abstract 501. Title: Biosimilar infliximab use in paediatric IBD.
Publication Date: 2018-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28988215
Abstract: Biosimilar infliximab became available in the UK in 2015. Paediatric experience to date on its use is limited. We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of biosimilar infliximab (Remsima) in two paediatric gastroenterology networks in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Prospective clinical data were collected from laboratory reports, electronic patient records and case notes of 40 patients starting Remsima for the first time. Disease activity scores together with blood and stool biomarkers were used to assess response.
Our data set highlights that Remsima was associated with a significant clinical and biochemical improvement (p<0.01 or less for all parameters assessed) in Crohn's disease post induction. There were no significant safety issues noted. The total cost saving was £47 800, representing a 38% reduction from originator.
We found that biosimilar infliximab is as effective as originator infliximab and its use is associated with significant cost savings.

Abstract 502. Title: Review article: biosimilars are the next generation of drugs for liver and gastrointestinal diseases.
Publication Date: 2013-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24001128
Abstract: A biosimilar is a copy version of an approved original biological medicine whose data protection has expired.
To provide an overview of the development of biosimilars worldwide.
Literature review of manufacturing processes of biosimilars, differences and similarities between biosimilars and the reference product, approval pathways for biosimilars, challenges in clinical trial study design and available data from clinical trials.
Biosimilars have the same amino acid sequence and highly similar glycosylation patterns that overlap with the originator product. Both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that might have profound effects on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Their main advantage is related to cost savings. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials, post-marketing pharmacoviligance and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar are requirements before approval. Non-inferiority or equivalence trials are required by regulatory agencies. Over the past years, several biosimilars have been approved such as erythropoietin or growth factors. Recently, two monoclonal antibodies, Remsima and Inflectra, have been shown to be equivalent to infliximab (INX) in safety and efficacy in rheumatologic conditions. Interchangeability, automatic substitution and switching are key issues when treating patients with biosimilars in clinical practice.
Biosimilars represent a new generation of drugs in liver and gastrointestinal diseases. On June 27, 2013, Hospira's Inflectra (INX) was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to receive positive opinion from European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and plaque psoriasis.

Abstract 503. Title: Copies of nonbiological complex drugs: generic, hybrid or biosimilar?
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30086403
Abstract: The experience gained with biosimilars has made it clear that copies of complex drugs are more challenging to produce and put on the market than generics. In the case of so-called nonbiological complex drugs (NBCDs), the complexity can arise either from a complex active substance or by other factors, such as formulation or route of delivery. Regulatory policies in the USA and the EU for the marketing of NBCD copies are reviewed, using glatiramer acetate copies as a case study. In the USA, they are approved and marketed as generics (although needing additional data), and so they are interchangeable with the originator. In the EU, they are managed with a hybrid application, and their interchangeability and substitution are established by individual member states.

Abstract 504. Title: Biosimilar switching and related medical liability.
Publication Date: 2018-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29476937
Abstract: Unlike generics, biosimilars are similar, but not equivalent, to the reference biological medicinal product. Therefore, if a patient experiences an adverse event, or a loss of efficacy, when transitioned to a biosimilar, the distribution of medical liability will be different from the case of both the originator and generics. Moreover, the case of naïve patients is different from that of non-naïve patients. In the case of naïve patients, physicians make their choice from a range of medicinal products that pose the same risk, since it is not possible to know with any certainty the patients' response to each therapeutic option until they have taken the drug. If physicians, instead, switch to a biosimilar for a patient already in treatment with the originator, they are switching from an option where the individual response is known, to an option where it is unknown. Given the evolving framework of biosimilar legislation, sharing choices with patients and obtaining their informed consent when switching to a biosimilar could represent an effective approach on the part of the prescribing physician. Moreover, a supranational database containing real-life data about patients in treatment with biological medicines, including information on the actual biological medicinal products administered, could complement the data obtained from clinical studies.

Abstract 505. Title: Economic Evaluation of Ferric Carboxymaltose for the Management of Hemodialysis Patients with Iron Deficiency Anemia in Italy.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31489572
Abstract: Patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (HD) are at high risk of developing both iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The administration of intravenous iron therefore represents the standard of care for the management of anemia in this patient setting.
A retrospective cohort of 38 HD patients in Italy was analyzed to assess the clinical and economic implications of switching from intravenous ferric gluconate (FG) to ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on achievement of adequate hemoglobin (Hb) values and iron balance. The total observational period for each patient was 12 months, 6 months before and 6 months after switching to iron FCM. The pharmacoeconomic analysis considered the hospital perspective and the consumption of iron, blood transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), including healthcare personnel time.
Switching from FG to FCM in dialysis adult patients with IDA allows a cost reduction per patient/month in the range €14-46, considering the use of biosimilar ESA or originator ESA, respectively. The percentage of patients with Hb target values increased from 63% to 82%, considering the entire observation period. In addition, other clinical parameters (ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin resistance index) improved after switching from FG to FCM.
FCM in HD patients was shown to provide a favorable efficacy profile over FG, with a lower cost per patient, mainly driven by a consistent reduction of ESA consumption.

Abstract 506. Title: Effect of switching recombinant human growth hormone: Comparative analysis of phase 3 clinical data.
Publication Date: 2011-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24392295
Abstract: Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is effective and safe when used to treat growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. However, it has been suggested that switching between different types of rhGH can have a detrimental effect on patients.
The current analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of rhGH in children who received continuous Omnitrope® (Sandoz GmbH, Kundl, Austria) therapy either with lyophilized powder for solution or ready-to-use solution, with children who received 9 months of treatment with Genotropin® (Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, UK) followed by Omnitrope solution thereafter. Changes to height, height SD score (SDS), height velocity SDS, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels, and IGF binding protein (IGFBP-3) levels were assessed using data from three trials.
Baseline demographics of the three study groups were similar. Over an 18-month period there were no observable differences between the three groups with respect to height, height SDS, height velocity SDS, IGF-1 levels, and IGFBP-3 levels. This result was corroborated by the model data, whereby most data points for Omnitrope-treated children fell within the defined limits of the prediction model based on Genotropin data. Few adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred.
Switching from Genotropin to Omnitrope solution has no impact on efficacy or safety in children with GHD, and the various rhGH preparations are well tolerated.

Abstract 507. Title: Demystifying biosimilars: development, regulation and clinical use.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30500264
Abstract: Biologics are an integral component in the treatment of various diseases. However, limited patient access to these medicines remains a significant global challenge, prompting development of safe and effective biosimilars. A biosimilar is 'highly similar to a reference (originator) product, for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the two products in terms of safety, purity and potency'. Biosimilars have the potential to offer possible benefits, including lower treatment costs, thereby increasing patient access and clinical use, which may lead to better overall outcomes. Improved understanding of biosimilars may enhance confidence and trust in these agents. As increasing numbers of biosimilars achieve regulatory approval, this overview aims to address enduring knowledge gaps regarding the development and use of biosimilars.

Abstract 508. Title: Antibodies to infliximab in Remicade-treated rheumatic patients show identical reactivity towards biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2016-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26965981
Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine whether antibodies to infliximab (IFX) in Remicade-treated patients cross-react with the biosimilar CT-P13.
250 consecutive patients with rheumatic diseases under Remicade and 77 controls were retrospectively selected for the study. Anti-IFX antibodies at drug through levels were measured in parallel with three different bridging ELISA assays: Promonitor-ANTI-IFX kit, which uses Remicade to detect antibodies, and two more assays that use either Inflectra or Remsima with the same format. Correlation and association between each assay was studied.
50.4% of patients were tested positive with Promonitor-ANTI-IFX. All were antibodies to IFX (ATI)-positive when either Inflectra or Remsima assays were used. In all comparisons positive and negative percentage agreements were 100%, and correlation coefficients were ≥0.995. No differences between rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, or between concomitant immunosuppressives, were observed.
Anti-IFX antibodies of Remicade-treated patients cross-react with either Inflectra or Remsima. Although additional epitopes may be present in the biosimilar, results suggest that epitopes influencing the immune response to IFX are also present in the biosimilar. Antibody-positive patients treated with Remicade should not be switched to the biosimilar, since antibodies will interact with the new drug and potentially lead to loss of response. This finding supports the utility for therapeutic drug monitoring before a switching strategy is considered.

Abstract: The introduction of biosimilars into our therapeutic arsenal has revolutionized the accessibility of biological treatments to patients with psoriasis, mainly from an economic standpoint. At this point, it is interesting to assess what their current positioning is.
A bibliographic review has been carried out that includes the technical sheets of the different drugs, criteria for the use of biosimilars, the current situation of the main prescribing countries, and data on actual clinical practice in the period 2015-2020 using the Pubmed® and Embase databases. ®.Accessibility varies from country to country, regardless of the standards set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA), owing to the need for biosimilars to be submitted for approval to local regulatory agencies. The switching/interchangeability/substitution criteria are not homogeneous, with variable outcomes ranging from clinical trials (for example, Norway) to mere non-binding recommendations.
The use of biosimilars is appropriate for a high percentage of patients. Its position as first-line drugs compared to traditional systemic drugs and the new anti-IL molecules must be reviewed since clinical choice cannot be based on economic aspects only.

Abstract 511. Title: Post-marketing analysis for biosimilar CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease compared with external data of originator infliximab in Japan.
Publication Date: 2021-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33450057
Abstract: CT-P13, an infliximab (IFX) biosimilar, was approved for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. However, no comparison with the originator IFX in this indication has been conducted in Japan where endemic levels of tuberculosis and hepatitis virus infection are not low. We evaluated the safety and efficacy in real-world data of CT-P13 and compared with originator IFX data in Japan.
In a prospective post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study, patients who received CT-P13 in a 28-month period from January 2015 were followed up for 2 years. By conducting Japanese administrative database search (DBS) for the same period of PMS, data of the originator IFX including treatment persistence, tuberculosis incidence, and liver injury were analyzed retrospectively and compared with the corresponding PMS data of CT-P13.
CT-P13 persistence in PMS (n = 640) and IFX persistence in DBS (n = 4113) were almost similar between patients who switched from the originator and patients who continued on the originator, and also between the biologics-naïve patient groups. There were no differences in the incidences of tuberculosis and hepatic injury (Tuberculosis: 2 patients [0.31%] with CT-P13, 10 patients [0.24%] with the originator, P = 0.75; Hepatic injury: 18.5% with CT-P13, 15.4% with the originator, P = 0.22). Most of the patients with hepatic injury continued treatment in PMS and DBS at similar rates (80.8% vs 83.6%, P = 0.65).
The results of long-term PMS of CT-P13 compared with external reference data from an administrative database suggested that the biosimilar and its originator were comparably useful in real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Pegfilgrastim is widely used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The development and use of biosimilar agents help to rationalize healthcare expenditure and improve access to modern therapies to all who need them. This review focuses on pegfilgrastims with important role in oncology supportive care. RGB-02 (Gedeon Richter) is a proposed biosimilar to pegylated granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Neulasta<sup>®</sup>, Amgen) with sustained release properties. The clinical analyses in three randomized clinical studies provided comparative data between RGB-02 and Neulasta, in a Phase III study patients receiving docetaxel-doxorubicin chemotherapy treatment equivalence was found. No difference was detected in any safety measure including immunogenicity; treatment switch, from the reference product to RGB-02 proved safe. Long-acting pegylated filgrastim RGB-02 has successfully accomplished various steps of biosimilar development.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30468397
Abstract: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate adherence, switch and costs a year after the start of treatment with different erythropoietin-stimulating agents. There were 277 patients, 200 were originators (72.20%) and 77 (27.80%) were biosimilars. Adherence to treatment for originators is 0.84 ± 0.22 versus 0.76 ± 0.27 for biosimilars (p = 0.3241). Medication adherence was calculated as ratio between received daily dose to prescribed daily dose. The optimum value is 1, values less than 1 indicate loss of adherence.  The cost of treatment per year is €7365 per patient for the use of the originator drug versus €2587 for biosimilars, with a difference of €4777 per patient.

Abstract 514. Title: Cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib compared with infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Germany.
Publication Date: 2021-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33502905
Abstract: Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in Germany.
A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and conventional therapy. Health states modeled were remission, treatment response, active UC, and post-colectomy. Patients not responding to treatment could switch to a different treatment. Treatment efficacy for induction and maintenance phases were assessed by a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The model included costs associated with drug administration, adverse events, and medical resource use. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted.
Over a life-time horizon, patients treated with tofacitinib gained 0.035-0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and had direct cost savings to the SHI of €4,228-€17,184 compared to biologic treatments other than adalimumab biosimilar. When compared to adalimumab biosimilar, treatment with tofacitinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €17,497 per QALY gained and can be considered a cost-effective alternative. Compared with conventional therapy, tofacitinib resulted in a lower ICER than all other biologics. The DSA showed that the model results were most influenced by differences in treatment efficacy. The PSA suggested confidence in the base-case results considering uncertainty around parameters.
The results of this economic model suggest tofacitinib is a cost-effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe UC in Germany.

Abstract 515. Title: Physicians' perceptions of the uptake of biosimilars: a systematic review.
Publication Date: 2020-May-05
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371511
Abstract: To examine physicians' perceptions of the uptake of biosimilars.
Systematic review.
MedLine Ovid and Scopus databases at the end of 2018.
Original scientific studies written in English that addressed physicians' perceptions of the uptake of biosimilars.
The search resulted in altogether 451 studies and 331 after removing duplicates. Two researchers examined these based on the title, abstract and entire text, resulting in 20 studies. The references in these 20 studies were screened and three further studies were included. The data of these 23 studies were extracted. All the publications were quality assessed by two researchers.
Most of the selected studies were conducted in Europe and commonly used short surveys. Physicians' familiarity with biosimilars varied: 49%-76% were familiar with biosimilars while 2%-25% did not know what biosimilars were, the percentages varying from study to study. Their measured knowledge was generally more limited compared with their self-assessed knowledge. Physicians' perceptions of biosimilars also varied: 54%-94% were confident prescribing biosimilars, while 65%-67% had concerns regarding these medicines. Physicians seemed to prefer originator products to biosimilars and prescribed biosimilars mainly for biologic-naive patients. They considered cost savings and the lower price compared with the originator biologic medicine as the main advantages of biosimilars, while their doubts were often related to safety, efficacy and immunogenicity. 64%-95% of physicians had negative perceptions of pharmacist-led substitution of biologic medicines.
Physicians' knowledge of and attitudes towards biosimilars vary. Although physicians had positive attitudes towards biosimilars, prescribing was limited, especially for patients already being treated with biologic medicines. Perceptions of pharmacist-led substitution of biologic medicines were often negative. Education and national recommendations for switching and substitution of biologic medicines are needed to support the uptake of biosimilars.

Abstract 516. Title: Active Surveillance of Follow-on Biologics: A Prescription for Uptake.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27838823
Abstract: As lower-cost versions of original biologic drugs made by different manufacturers, follow-on biologics offer the promise of meaningful savings for the US health care system and improved patient health outcomes through greater medication adherence. Fulfillment of this promise, however, is predicated on the prescribing of such products. Under state drug product selection laws, pharmacists may substitute prescriptions for brand name, small-molecule drugs with their generic equivalents, but will be indefinitely prohibited from substituting prescriptions for original biologics with their follow-on biologic counterparts given a lack of product-specific guidance on demonstrating interchangeability. Even when interchangeable follow-on biologics become available, they will face heightened barriers to substitution following the enactment of so-called carve-outs in several states. Data collected to date suggest that a substantial proportion of US physicians remain skeptical of follow-on biologics despite their long record of safe and effective use in Europe. Active surveillance of follow-on biologics within the US market using insurance claims databases can help address this skepticism and help answer key questions concerning the safety of switching between original and follow-on products or between different follow-on products, and of extrapolating to broader indications. Funding is needed to support such surveillance activities and to disseminate the findings to key stakeholders.

Abstract 517. Title: Systemic rheumatic diseases: From biological agents to small molecules.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30959214
Abstract: The development of biologics and small oral molecules has recently changed the scenario of pharmacologic treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases and it has become a real revolution. These drugs have innovative mechanisms of action, based on the inhibition of specific molecular or cellular targets directly involved in disease pathogenesis. This new scenario has lead to a regular update of the management recommendations of several institutions, such as those for Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment that address the use of conventional and biologic therapies including TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab), biosimilars and small oral molecules (the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (such as treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission or low disease activity are the final goal of the guidelines for rheumatic patients management. In another condition represented by Axial Spondyloarthritis guidelines suggest to start first with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to improve lifestyle and reduce spine inflammation, but if this is not achieved in 2-4 weeks it is important to consider the use of local therapies (i.e. glucocorticoid injections) or to start biologic therapy such as TNF inhibitors and then eventually switching to another TNF inhibitor or swapping to IL-17 inhibitor. In the case of active Psoriatic Arthritis, guidelines suggest to start with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even local glucocorticoid injections especially for oligoarthritis, then to start conventional therapies if lack of efficacy, and finally start biologics or small oral molecules in the presence of drugs toxicity, unfavorable prognostic factors and still active arthritis. In several cases, active Psoriatic Arthritis patients develop a complex clinical condition with comorbidities such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and high risk of infections, and for this reason the American College of Rheumatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation have developed specific guidelines for their management. Biologic and new small molecules therapies are very expensive, but the availability of biosimilars offers the opportunity of reducing the treatment cost and significantly decreasing the cost of originators as well. In fact, we live in a period characterized by the need to rationalize costs of these drugs, to allow treating a higher number of patients and to maintain a homogeneous possibility of treatment choice. For these reasons, we need to follow scientific guidelines and patients' clinical conditions to choose the correct treatment, also based on the economic burden of therapies.

Abstract 518. Title: Biosimilars vs originators: Are they the same?
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31639517
Abstract: Biological drugs have revolutionised the treatment of rheumatic diseases, and the recent expiry of the patents for many biological agents has generated considerable interest among pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies, and led to the marketing of highly similar, low-cost versions known as biosimilars. The increasing trend of switching patients from effective but expensive drugs to their biosimilar counterparts will have a considerable economic impact in the coming years. However, although this will greatly extend patient access the latest treatments, clinicians, scientific societies and the patients themselves have expressed a number of concerns about their long-term efficacy and safety, as well as the consequences of potentially multiple switches being dictated by economic pressure rather than medical needs. Thee aim of this review is to evaluate the pros and cons of choosing biosimilars, and whether and when they can really be considered clinically equivalent to the original drugs.

Abstract 519. Title: Challenges constraining availability and affordability of insulin in Bengaluru region (Karnataka, India): evidence from a mixed-methods study.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31636912
Abstract: Considering limited global access to affordable insulin, we evaluated insulin access in public and private health sectors in Bengaluru, India.
Employing modified WHO/HAI methodology, we used mixed-methods analysis to study insulin access and factors influencing insulin supply and demand in Bengaluru in December 2017. We assessed insulin availability, price and affordability in a representative sample of 5 public-sector hospitals, 5 private-sector hospitals and 30 retail pharmacies. We obtained insulin price data from websites of government Jan Aushadhi scheme (JAS) and four online private-sector retail pharmacies. We interviewed wholesalers in April 2018 to understand insulin market dynamics.
Mean availability of insulins on India's 2015 Essential Medicine List was 66.7% in the public sector, lower than private-sector retail (76.1%) and hospital pharmacies (93.3%). Among private retailers, mean availability was higher among chain (96.7%) than independent pharmacies (68.3%). Non-Indian companies supplied 67.3% products in both sectors. 79.1% products were manufactured in India, of which 60% were marketed by non-Indian companies.In private retail pharmacies, median consumer prices of human insulin cartridges and pens were 2.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, that of human insulin vials. Analogues depending on delivery device were twice as expensive as human insulin. Human insulin vials were 18.3% less expensive in JAS pharmacies than private retail pharmacies. The lowest paid unskilled worker would pay 1.4 to 9.3 days' wages for a month's supply, depending on insulin type and health sector. Wholesaler interviews suggest that challenges constraining patient insulin access include limited market competition, physicians' preference for non-Indian insulins, and the ongoing transition from human to analogue insulin. Rising popularity of online and chain pharmacies may influence insulin access.
Insulin availability in Bengaluru's public sector falls short of WHO's 80% target. Insulin remains unaffordable in both private and public sectors. To improve insulin availability and affordability, government should streamline insulin procurement and supply chains at different levels, mandate biosimilar prescribing, educate physicians to pursue evidence-based prescribing, and empower pharmacists with brand substitution. Patients must be encouraged to shop around for lower prices from subsidized schemes like JAS. While non-Indian companies dominate Bengaluru's insulin market, rising market competition from Indian companies may improve access.

Abstract 520. Title: A novel approach to support implementation of biosimilars within a UK tertiary hospital.
Publication Date: 2020-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31663154
Abstract: Aims To assess the transfer of patients treated with originator biological therapies to biosimilar products in a large UK tertiary referral hospital reflecting practice within the National Health Service (NHS) using prospectively collected data by a hospital-based registry administered by the Biologics Steering Group (BSG).
We analysed data collected prospectively in a hospital-based registry in a large NHS tertiary referral hospital in the UK. The registry was administered by the hospital's BSG, which considered requests for patients to remain on or revert to originator products. The registry contained prospectively collected data on patients switching therapy from an originator to a biosimilar. The data included clinical circumstances or rationale for each request, whether it was granted, and the results of clinical reviews at 3-6 months.
In a 12-month period, we identified 1299 patients who could switch to the respective biosimilar and, of these, 1196 (92%) did so. Of the 260 patients taking infliximab, 250 (96%) switched to infliximab biosimilar; of the 390 patients taking etanercept 50 mg, 298 (76%) switched to etanercept 50 mg biosimilar; and of the 649 patients taking rituximab, 648 (99%) switched to rituximab biosimilar. The BSG received 39 applications: 12 (out of 39) applications were to remain on the originator and 27 (out of 39) were to switch back to the originator. Of the applications to remain on the originator 10 (out of 12) were approved. At 3-6 month review, 2 of these approvals reported continued efficacy, 3 switched to the biosimilar, 3 switched to an alternative therapy and 2 stopped treatment. Two (out of 10) applications were not approved, both applicants reported efficacy with the biosimilar at follow up. Of the 27 applications to switch back to the originator, 16 (out of 27) applications were approved. At 3-6 months, 9 (out of 16) applicants reported regain of efficacy, 6 (out of 16) reported cessation of reported adverse effects and 1 (out of 16) switched to alternative therapy. Eight (out of 27) applications were not approved, and, at point of follow up, 50% reported efficacy with the biosimilar and 50% had switched to an alternative therapy. Three (out of 27) applications were withdrawn by the clinical team as efficacy was achieved with the biosimilar.
We have set up a system within a busy NHS clinical practice to successfully switch patients to biosimilars, and established a mechanism to guide decisions on continuing with or reverting back to the originator. Such a system could be of use more broadly within the NHS and other health care systems.

Abstract 521. Title: Strengths, weaknesses and future challenges of biosimilars' development. An opinion on how to improve the knowledge and use of biosimilars in clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29113760
Abstract: Biosimilars started receiving the marketing authorization by European Medicine Agency since 2006. The development of biosimilars follows a well-defined step-wise approach, the so-called comparability exercise, which aims to compare non-clinical (mainly quality features and biological activity) and clinical (efficacy and safety profiles) features of new biosimilars with their respective reference products. Despite the undeniable advantages of such procedure, some concerns (such as the absence of switching studies or the evaluation of efficacy and safety in all therapeutic indications) still exist about its. In particular, the European regulatory framework on biosimilars approval does not include the conduction of switching studies demonstrating the interchangeability to be carried out before marketing authorization. This is one of the main aspects that negatively affects healthcare professionals' clinical decisions on switch. In order to achieve a better knowledge on safety and efficacy of biosimilar drugs, real world data should be collected and post-marketing efficacy and safety clinical studies (including those evaluating specific endpoints, therapeutic regimens and patients population), should be planned. also the conduction of well-designed switching studies is highly advisable, especially in the case of biosimilar drugs used in oncology settings. Lastly, considering the critical role of antidrug antibodies on efficacy/safety profile of biologic drugs, studies based on therapeutic drug monitoring would be useful in order to achieve treatment optimization. Implementing the above strategies could be helpful to fill the gap in knowledge observed in the present European biosimilar regulatory framework.

Abstract 522. Title: The future landscape of biosimilars in rheumatology: Where we are where we are going.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572130
Abstract: The upcoming of biosimilars in rheumatic diseases have generated considerable interest throughout the past five years among pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies, their development is associated with considerable variation and heterogeneity on the variable requirements for license and marketing throughout the various continents.
In this article we reviewed the contents of the conference presented on the last XI International Conference in Autoimmunity in Lisbon.
Truly biosimilars that followed requirements from stringent agencies are now available and licensed for infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and rituximab but several compounds from the same mechanism of action are also being developed and are reviewed and the strengths of their evidence analized and discussed. The use of intended copies (biomimics) and its presence in less regulated markets are also reviewed and the risks of their use without proper monitoring is also evaluated.
Biosimilars for rheumatic diseases is expected to change the access of patients to high costs biologics and gradually more and more patients are being switched to biosimilars either by the rheumatologist prescription or mandatory national indications. The economic impact is expected to be huge in the coming years. Second generation biosimilars are also being developed and clinical trials are underway for license in the near future.

Abstract 523. Title: The advent of biosimilar therapies in rheumatology--"O brave new world".
Publication Date: 2012-Jun-05
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22664834
Abstract: Patents for many key biological agents will soon expire. Third-party companies are, therefore, in the process of developing their own versions, termed biosimilar agents, of these innovator products. However, manufacture of biosimilar agents is complicated by the requirement for their production in biological systems, small variations in which can influence the structure, activity and metabolism of the biosimilar product. The development of biosimilar therapies for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases could potentially result in substantial cost savings for patients and health care providers, and consequently, increased availability of effective therapies. However, legislation that regulates the manufacture, registration and approval of biosimilar therapies varies considerably between different countries. In addition, major safety and efficacy concerns must be addressed before a rheumatologist can routinely substitute an innovator pharmaceutical with a biosimilar product.

Abstract 524. Title: How to regulate nonbiological complex drugs (NBCD) and their follow-on versions: points to consider.
Publication Date: 2014-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065600
Abstract: The aim of this critical review is to reach a global consensus regarding the introduction of follow-on versions of nonbiological complex drugs (NBCD). A nonbiological complex drug is a medicinal product, not being a biological medicine, where the active substance is not a homo-molecular structure, but consists of different (closely related and often nanoparticulate) structures that cannot be isolated and fully quantitated, characterized and/or described by state of the art physicochemical analytical means and where the clinical meaning of the differences is not known. The composition, quality and in vivo performance of NBCD are highly dependent on manufacturing processes of both the active ingredient as well as in most cases the formulation. The challenges posed by the development of follow-on versions of NBCD are illustrated in this paper by discussing the 'families' of liposomes, iron-carbohydrate ('iron-sugar') drugs and glatiramoids. It is proposed that the same principles for the marketing authorization of copies of NBCD as for biosimilars be used: the need for animal and/or clinical data and the need to show similarity in quality, safety and efficacy. The regulatory approach of NBCD will have to take into consideration the specific characteristics of the drugs, their formulation and manufacturing process and the resulting critical attributes to achieve their desired quality, safety and efficacy. As with the biosimilars, for the NBCD product, family-specific methods should be evaluated and applied where scientifically proven, including sophisticated quality methods, pharmacodynamic markers and animal models. Concerning substitution and interchangeability of NBCD, it is also advisable to take biosimilars as an example, i.e. (1) substitution without the involvement of a healthcare professional should be discouraged to ensure traceability of the treatment of individual patients, (2) keep an individual patient on a specific treatment if the patient is doing well and only switch if unavoidable and (3) monitor the safety and efficacy of the new product if switching occurs.

Abstract 525. Title: Acceptance rate and sociological factors involved in the switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept (SB4).
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30093238
Abstract: To study acceptance rate and factors influencing acceptance of the switch from originator etanercept (Enbrel©) to biosimilar etanercept (SB4, Bénépali©) in patients with rheumatic disease.
Patients with a well-controlled rheumatic disease consulting in our rheumatology department were offered the switch for SB4. After oral and written information concerning biosimilar, free choice to accept the switch was left to the patients. The main outcome was primary switch acceptance rate defined by switch acceptance during the initial consult. Real switch adherence, socio-cultural factors and beliefs influencing switch acceptance rate were retrieved during a telephonic interview at distance from the consultation.
Fifty-two patients were eligible for the switch: 32 (62%) with spondyloarthritis and 20 (38%) with rheumatoid arthritis. The primary acceptance rate was 92% (48/52). Patients refusing the switch were more likely to report a bad opinion on generic drugs (100% vs 11%, p < 0.001). Other patient characteristics were roughly identical except for a statistical trend in the refusal group toward older age (61.4vs 50.7years, p = 0.08) and longer disease duration (26vs 12.1years, p = 0.05). Despite initial acceptance, two patients did not begin SB4 after receiving negative information by their regular pharmacist. Real SB4 switch rate was 85% (44/52) and 86% (38/44) of patients reported a good experience of the switch.
Acceptance rate of the switch from originator to biosimilar etanercept is high. Patient information, physician and pharmacist knowledge on biosimilars should be taken into account in order to improve their diffusion.

Abstract 526. Title: Current perspective on rituximab in rheumatic diseases.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29042750
Abstract: The steadily increasing knowledge regarding pathogenetic mechanisms in autoimmune rheumatic diseases has paved the way to different therapeutic approaches. In particular, the market entry of biologics has dramatically modified the natural history of rheumatic chronic inflammatory diseases with a meaningful impact on patients' quality of life. Among the wide spectrum of available biological treatments, rituximab (RTX), first used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was later approved for rheumatoid arthritis and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis. Nowadays, in rheumatology, RTX is also used with off-label indications in patients with systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. RTX is a monoclonal antibody directed to CD20 molecules expressed on the surfaces of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. It acts by causing apoptosis of these cells with antibody- and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. As inflammatory responses to cell-associated immune complexes are key elements in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such an approach might be effective in these patients. In fact, RTX, by promoting the rapid and long-term depletion of circulating and lymphoid tissue-associated B cells, leads to a lower recruitment of these effector cells at sites of immune complex deposition, thus reducing inflammation and tissue damage. RTX is of the most interest to rheumatologists as it represents an important additional therapeutic approach. Thus, the advent in clinical practice of approved RTX biosimilars, such as CT-P10, may be of help in improving treatment access as well as in reducing costs.

Abstract 527. Title: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as a tool in the switch from infliximab innovator to biosimilar in rheumatic patients: results of a 12-month observational prospective cohort study.
Publication Date: 2017-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28593609
Abstract: The objective of this study is to apply therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as an objective tool to monitor the switch from infliximab innovator (INX) to infliximab biosimilar (INB) in our diverse rheumatic cohort in daily clinical practice. All rheumatic patients on INX treatment (Remicade®) and ≥18 years were switched to INB (Inflectra®) as part of routine care, but in a controlled setting. Patients were monitored by taking blood samples just before the first infusion of INB (T1), and after the second (T2), fourth (T3), and seventh (T4) infusion of INB. T4 reflects the patients' status after ∼12 months. Infliximab trough levels, antibodies-to-infliximab (ATI), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and validated disease activity scores (if possible) were measured. Our population consisted of 27 patients with seven different rheumatic diseases who had received INX for 143 (58-161) months (median (IQR)). Half of the patients (52%) received concomitant immunosuppressives. We found widely varying infliximab levels, with only 56% within the proposed therapeutic range of 1-5 μg/mL. One patient had very high ATI levels (>880 au/mL), and two had low ATI levels (≤30 au/mL). After switching to INB, seven patients (26%) discontinued the therapy, partially due to subjective reasons. No difference in infliximab levels, CRP levels, and disease activity scores was found between the four time points (p ≥ 0.2460). In conclusion, no pharmacokinetic or clinical differences were found between INX and INB in our diverse rheumatic cohort. TDM is a helpful tool to monitor patients switching from INX to INB.

Abstract: Biosimilars are currently a hot topic and there are many unsolved questions, misunderstandings and sometimes considerable uncertainty, especially among clinicians and patients. Regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issue guidelines for the development and approval of biosimilars, which are based on scientific principles.
This article addresses some of the frequently noted misunderstandings and misperceptions. For example, why biosimilars are (or can only be) "similar" but not "identical" compared to the original pharmaceutical product, and aspects, such as the pharmaceutical quality of biosimilars, immunogenicity and the approval process for biosimilars are highlighted.

Abstract 529. Title: Randomized Controlled Trial: Subcutaneous vs Intravenous Infliximab CT-P13 Maintenance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676969
Abstract: This study compared pharmacokinetics, symptomatic and endoscopic efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a subcutaneous formulation of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 (CT-P13 SC) vs intravenous CT-P13 (CT-P13 IV) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
This randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, phase 1 study enrolled tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-naïve patients with active ulcerative colitis (total Mayo score 6-12 points with endoscopic subscore ≥2) or Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index 220-450 points) at 50 centers. After CT-P13 IV induction at Week (W) 0/W2, patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P13 SC every 2 weeks (q2w) from W6 to W54 or CT-P13 IV every 8 weeks from W6 to W22. At W30, all patients receiving CT-P13 IV switched to CT-P13 SC q2w until W54. The primary endpoint was noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV for observed predose CT-P13 concentration at W22 (C<sub>trough,W22</sub>), concluded if the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric least-squares means exceeded 80%.
Overall, 66 and 65 patients were randomized to CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV, respectively. The primary endpoint of noninferiority was met with a geometric least-squares means ratio for C<sub>trough,W22</sub> of 1154.17% (90% CI 786.37-1694.00; n = 59 [CT-P13 SC]; n = 57 [CT-P13 IV]). W30/W54 clinical remission rates were comparable between arms. Other efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity assessments were also broadly comparable between arms, including after switching.
The pharmacokinetic noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV, and the comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles, support the potential suitability of CT-P13 SC treatment in IBD. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02883452.

Abstract 530. Title: [Evolution of biologicals in inflammation medicine--biosimilars in gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology].
Publication Date: 2014-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25390629
Abstract: Biologicals revolutionized the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases in gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology in the last decade. The first generation biologicals mainly targeted against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. The evolution of these therapies in the last years led to the development of new antibodies and to the admission of first generation "generic" biologics - the biosimilars. Biosimilars are not a fundamental new pharmacological development for existing substances, however they have the potential to lead to enormous cost savings in healthcare without reducing the level of care for patients. Biosimilars are not identical with the originator, but in an extensive biosimilarity exercise including analytical, preclinical and comparative clinical studies it was shown that the biosimilars could demonstrate comparability in all relevant aspects with the originator.In September 2013, the Infliximab biosimilars (Inflectra(®), Remsina(®)) were the first biosimilars for monoclonal antibodies to be authorized by the EMA for use in the European Union. By demonstrating the therapeutic similarity only in one indication (rheumatoid arthritis) the EMA agreed with an extrapolation also to all approved indications of the originator. This could be a relevant problem in clinical practice. Therefore, comparative studies with the originator are required in all approved indications.After expiration of the national patent protection in beginning of 2015, the infliximab biosimilars will be launched on the market in Germany and will be part of the therapeutic arsenal in gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. Interchangeability (Switching) of biosimilars with the originator will be subject of an important discussion with the health care providers. Regardless of the biosimilars EMA-approval, several potential problems (efficacy, extrapolation, switching, long-term safety) should be the topic of intensive long-term registries in the future.

Abstract 531. Title: Biosimilars in rheumatology: A review of the evidence and their place in the treatment algorithm.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28903543
Abstract: Determining biosimilarity involves a comprehensive exercise with a focus on determining the comparability of the molecular characteristics and preclinical profile of the biosimilar and reference product, such that there is less need for extensive clinical testing to assure comparability of clinical outcomes. Three anti-TNF biosimilar agents are approved for patients with rheumatic diseases in the European Union. The infliximab (Remicade®) biosimilars CT-P13 (Remsima® and Inflectra®) and SB2 (Flixabi®) and the etanercept (Enbrel®) biosimilar SB4 (Benepali®) have shown close comparability to their reference medicinal products, having undergone extensive evaluations. Guidelines on the treatment of rheumatic diseases have acknowledged that biosimilars and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are interchangeable in clinical practice, except when patients experience lack of efficacy or tolerability with the reference agent. Given that cost is a barrier to effective bDMARD use, the introduction of less costly biosimilars is likely to widen access and dissipate treatment inequalities. Physicians faced with prescribing decisions should be reassured by the robust and exhaustive process that is involved in assuring comparability of biosimilars with their reference agents. De novo usage of a biosimilar and switching to a biosimilar following lack of efficacy or tolerability with a different reference biologic agent are likely to be strategies most easily adopted, although switching during successful treatment should also be considered given the potential cost implications. The introduction of biosimilar bDMARDs has the potential to improve patient access to effective biologic therapy, to better accommodate restraints within healthcare budgets and to improve overall patient outcomes.

Abstract 532. Title: The Biosulin equivalence in standard therapy (BEST) study - a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, interventional, observational study in subjects using Biosulin 30/70 for the treatment of insulin-dependent type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Publication Date: 2013-Apr-02
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23802207
Abstract: The need for more cost-effective insulin therapy is critical in reducing the burden on patients and health systems. Biosimilar insulins have the potential to dramatically lower healthcare costs by delivering insulin with a similar anti-glycaemic effect and adverse reaction profile.
The purpose of this study was to confirm equivalence in glycaemic outcomes and side-effect profiles between Biosulin 30/70 and other human premixed insulin preparations on the South African market in a clinical practice setting.
Subjects in this interventional, observational, multicentre, open-label, prospective study were switched from their existing human premix insulin (Actraphane, Humulin 30/70 or Insuman) to the study insulin Biosulin 30/70. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months.
Seventy-seven adult patients with type 1(n=18) or type 2 (n=59) diabetes were enrolled. The baseline HbA1c in the overall cohort was 7.9%, 8.0% at 3 months (p=0.50) and 7.6% at 6 months (p=0.14).There was a small increase in the total daily dose of insulin used in both the type 1 and type 2 cohort, from 0.62 to 0.65 units/kg/day (p=0.0004). There was no significant difference in weight in the study subjects during the 6-month period on Biosulin 30/70 (p=0.67).
Biosulin 30/70 achieved at least equivalent glycaemic control to existing human premix insulins, with no reported new or severe adverse events. Increased use of biosimilar insulins has the potential for significant cost savings.

Abstract 533. Title: The Economic Impact of the Introduction of Biosimilars in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27571772
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] entails a high economic burden to society. We aimed to estimate the current and future impact of the introduction of biosimilars for infliximab on IBD-related health care costs.
We designed a stochastic economic model to simulate the introduction of biosimilars in IBD, using a 5-year time horizon, based on the Dutch situation. Prevalence data on ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD] and IBD-related health care costs data were used as input. Assumptions were made on price reductions of anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy, increase of anti-TNF prescription rate, and development of hospitalization costs. The base case scenario included a gradual decrease in prices of biosimilars up to 60%, a gradual decrease in prices of original anti-TNF compounds up to 50%, and an annual increase of anti-TNF prescription rate of 1%, and this was compared with no introduction of biosimilars. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
For the base case, cost savings over the total of 5 years were on average €9,850 per CD patient and €2,250 per UC patient, yielding in €493 million total cost savings [a reduction of 28%] for The Netherlands. Results were predominantly determined by price reduction of anti-TNF therapy, threshold price reduction at which physicians switch patients towards biosimilars and the extent to which switching will take place.
The introduction of biosimilars for infliximab can be expected to have a major impact on the cost profile of IBD. The economic impact will depend on local pricing, procurement policies and the physician's willingness to switch patients to biosimilars.

Abstract 534. Title: Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Insulin Aspart Biosimilar SAR341402 Compared with Originator Insulin Aspart in Adults with Diabetes (GEMELLI 1): A Subgroup Analysis by Prior Type of Mealtime Insulin.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33432547
Abstract: The biosimilar SAR341402 insulin aspart (SAR-Asp) was compared to its originator NovoLog®/NovoRapid® insulin aspart (NN-Asp) in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes switching from different rapid-acting insulin analogs.
This phase 3, randomized, open-label, multinational, 52-week study (GEMELLI 1) enrolled participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (n = 597). At randomization, participants transitioned from NovoLog/NovoRapid (n = 380) or Humalog®/Liprolog® (n = 217) to equivalent (1:1) doses (or a dose at the discretion of the investigator) of either SAR-Asp or NN-Asp (1:1 randomization). Participants were treated with multiple daily injections in combination with insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus®). In this subgroup analysis, efficacy measures (change in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], insulin dose [total, basal and mealtime]), and safety outcomes (hypoglycemia incidence, adverse events, anti-insulin aspart antibodies) of SAR-Asp were compared with those of NN-Asp separately according to the participants' prestudy mealtime insulin.
At week 26 (primary efficacy endpoint), change in HbA1c was similar between SAR-Asp and NN-Asp in those participants pre-treated with NovoLog/NovoRapid (least squares [LS] mean difference - 0.04%, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.182 to 0.106%) or Humalog/Liprolog (LS mean difference - 0.15%, 95% CI - 0.336 to 0.043%) (P value for treatment by subgroup interaction = 0.36). This HbA1c response persisted over the 52 weeks of the study similarly for both treatments within each subgroup. In both subgroups, changes in insulin doses were similar between treatments over 26 weeks and 52 weeks, as were the incidences of severe or any hypoglycemia, adverse events (including hypersensitivity and injection site reactions), and anti-insulin aspart antibodies.
Efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity) profiles of SAR-Asp are similar to those of NN-Asp over 52 weeks in adults with diabetes irrespective of prior type of mealtime insulin.

Abstract 535. Title: Efficacy and safety of switching from rituximab to biosimilar CT-P10 in rheumatoid arthritis: 72-week data from a randomized Phase 3 trial.
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184752
Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CT-P10, a rituximab biosimilar after a single switch, during a multinational, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial involving patients with RA.
Patients received 48 weeks' treatment with CT-P10 or United States- or European Union-sourced reference rituximab (US-RTX and EU-RTX, respectively). Patients entering the extension period (weeks 48-72) remained on CT-P10 (CT-P10/CT-P10; n = 122) or US-RTX (US-RTX/US-RTX; n = 64), or switched to CT-P10 from US-RTX (US-RTX/CT-P10; n = 62) or EU-RTX (EU-RTX/CT-P10; n = 47) for an additional course. Efficacy endpoints included Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, and quality of life-related parameters. Pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety were also assessed.
At week 72, similar improvements were observed by disease activity parameters including DAS28 and ACR response rate in the four extension period treatment groups. Quality of life improvements at week 72 vs baseline were similarly shown during the extension period in all groups. Newly developed anti-drug antibodies were detected in two patients following study drug infusion in the extension period. Similar pharmacodynamic and safety profiles were observed across groups.
Long-term use of CT-P10 up to 72 weeks was effective and well tolerated. Furthermore, switching from reference rituximab to CT-P10 in RA was well tolerated and did not result in any clinically meaningful differences in terms of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety.

Abstract 536. Title: Discontinuation of biosimilar infliximab in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieving sustained clinical remission or low disease activity during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I (the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY II): Study protocol for an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial with clinical, ultrasound and biomarker assessments.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-07
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769882
Abstract: The introduction of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs into clinical practice has dramatically improved the clinical outcomes of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We are conducting the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I that evaluates whether switching from originator infliximab (IFX) to its biosimilar, CT-P13, is not inferior in maintaining nonclinical relapse to continue treatment with originator IFX in patients with RA achieving clinical remission. It is the next great issue whether disease activity can be maintained in good condition after discontinuation of CT-P13 because no evidence is available regarding the clinical value of discontinuing biosimilars in patients with RA. Thus, we will evaluate whether a condition without clinical relapse will be maintained after discontinuation of CT-P13 in patients with RA, achieving clinical remission or low disease activity during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I.
This study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial with a 48-week follow-up. Patients with RA who are treated with CT-P13 and sustained nonclinical relapse during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I will be included. Patients will discontinue CT-P13 after the study period of the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I. We will evaluate disease activity by clinical disease activity indices and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who do not have clinical relapse during the study period. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from the baseline of the MSUS scores. We will also comprehensively analyze the serum levels of multiple biomarkers, such as cytokines and chemokines. In addition, if a clinical relapse occurs in patients after the discontinuation of CT-P13, we will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13.
The study results are expected to show the clinical benefit of the discontinuation of CT-P13 and effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13 after clinical relapse. The strength of this study is to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness by not only clinical disease activity indices but also standardized MSUS findings in multiple centers. We will explore whether parameters at baseline can predict a nonclinical relapse after the discontinuation of CT-P13 by integrating multilateral assessments, that is, patient's characteristics, clinical disease activity indices, MSUS findings, and serum biomarkers.

Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32271092
Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of biosimilar insulin glargine (GLY) in real-world clinical practice.<b>Methods:</b> This prospective, non-interventional, multicenter, observational, post-marketing safety study (PMSS) enrolled Japanese patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM or T2DM) starting GLY therapy, and was required by Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law mandating post-marketing safety surveillance to acquire safety and effectiveness data of biosimilar products. Data collected from the 12-month observation included patient characteristics, adverse events, and blood glucose control.<b>Results:</b> The study enrolled 141 patients with T1DM and 1104 patients with T2DM. Pre-study insulin was used by 94.1% of patients with T1DM and 75.0% with T2DM. 65.4% of patients with T1DM and 64.3% with T2DM switched from the reference product (GLY-switched), while 25.0% with T2DM were insulin-naive. Adverse events were reported by 5.7% and 8.5% in T1DM and T2DM, respectively. Similar incidences were reported in GLY-switched. Adverse events were reported by 10.7% in insulin-naive T2DM. Baseline mean hypoglycemic events/month were 1.8 and 0.1 in T1DM and T2DM, respectively: the mean change from baseline (CFB) was -1.2 (<i>p</i> = .066) and 0.0 (<i>p</i> = .915), respectively. Baseline mean HbA1c was 8.4% and 8.7% in T1DM and T2DM, respectively; the mean CFB was -0.5% (<i>p</i> < .001) and -0.9% (<i>p</i> < .001), respectively, and -1.5% (<i>p</i> < .001) in insulin-naive T2DM.<b>Conclusions:</b> This first long-term Japanese PMSS of GLY demonstrated adverse events, hypoglycemia, and glycemic control consistent with the known GLY profile for T1DM and T2DM patients, in routine clinical practice.

Abstract 538. Title: Redesigning HVEM Interface for Selective Binding to LIGHT, BTLA, and CD160.
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-03
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795404
Abstract: Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) regulates positive and negative signals for T cell activation through co-signaling pathways. Dysfunction of the HVEM co-signaling network is associated with multiple pathologies related to autoimmunity, infectious disease, and cancer, making the associated molecules biologically and therapeutically attractive targets. HVEM interacts with three ligands from two different superfamilies using two different binding interfaces. The engagement with ligands CD160 and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), members of immunoglobulin superfamily, is associated with inhibitory signals, whereas inflammatory responses are regulated through the interaction with LIGHT from the TNF superfamily. We computationally redesigned the HVEM recognition interfaces using a residue-specific pharmacophore approach, ProtLID, to achieve switchable-binding specificity. In subsequent cell-based binding assays the new interfaces, designed with only single or double mutations, exhibited selective binding to only one or two out of the three cognate ligands.

Abstract 539. Title: Protein grafting of an HIV-1-inhibiting epitope.
Publication Date: 2003-Aug-19
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12913122
Abstract: Protein grafting, the transfer of a binding epitope of one ligand onto the surface of another protein, is a potentially powerful technique for presenting peptides in preformed and active three-dimensional conformations. Its utility, however, has been limited by low biological activity of the designed ligands and low tolerance of the protein scaffolds to surface substitutions. Here, we graft the complete binding epitope (19 nonconsecutive amino acids with a solvent-accessible surface area of >2,000 A2) of an HIV-1 C-peptide, which is derived from the C-terminal region of HIV-1 gp41 and potently inhibits HIV-1 entry into cells, onto the surface of a GCN4 leucine zipper. The designed peptide, named C34coil, displays a potent antiviral activity approaching that of the native ligand. Moreover, whereas the linear C-peptide is unstructured and sensitive to degradation by proteases, C34coil is well structured, conformationally stable, and exhibits increased resistance to proteolytic degradation compared with the linear peptide. In addition to being a structured antiviral inhibitor, C34coil may also serve as the basis for the development of an alternative class of immunogens. This study demonstrates that "one-shot" protein grafting, without subsequent rounds of optimization, can be used to create ligands with structural conformations and improved biomedical properties.

Abstract 540. Title: Switching Between Infliximab Originator and Biosimilar in Paediatric Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Preliminary Observations.
Publication Date: 2016-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26721942
Abstract: The growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children necessitates the use of biological treatments. Recently, an infliximab biosimilar was authorized in the European Union, which may result in switching patients. We present our preliminary experiences with such switches.
The prospective study included 32 paediatric patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) and 7 children with ulcerative colitis (UC) at 3 academic hospitals, who were switched from infliximab originator to its biosimilar (Remsima). Patient characteristics, disease severity, laboratory parameters and adverse events were recorded. Means, medians and ranges were calculated.
Mean age at diagnosis of CD and UC was 11.1 (2.7-15.3) and 12.3 years (8.5-14.8), respectively. Mean number of infliximab originator infusions before switching to the biosimilar was 9.9 (median 8, range 4-29) and 5.1 (5, 1-12) for the CD and UC group, respectively. Evaluation efficacy of last biosimilar doses of all patients revealed rates of clinical remission of 88 and 57% for CD and UC patients, respectively. Last follow-up assessment of patients who continued with biosimilar therapy showed that 16/20 (80%) CD patients and all 4 UC individuals were in remission. One infusion reaction to infliximab biosimilar was observed in a CD patient, which led to treatment discontinuation. The incidence of sporadic mild adverse events prior to and after switching did not differ significantly and was consistent with the safety profile of the infliximab molecule.
Switching from infliximab originator to its biosimilar seems to be a safe option in children with CD. After the switch the biosimilar was just as effective as the originator.

Abstract 541. Title: Experience with biosimilar infliximab (CT-P13) in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
Publication Date: 2016-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582886
Abstract: Infliximab was the first monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Over several years, this antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment proved its efficacy in both induction and maintenance therapy. In many cases this biological treatment stopped the progression of the disease, probably also decreasing morbidity and hospitalization rates, and improving patients' comfort. When the patent on infliximab started to expire, the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody was introduced onto the pharmacological market. Biosimilar infliximab was studied in rheumatology and proved a high similarity to the reference drug. Based on extrapolation, biosimilars were approved to treat adult and paediatric IBD patients. Biosimilar infliximab, mainly because of its lower cost, has started to be in common use in Europe. The first studies have shown a similar efficacy and safety profile in comparison with reference drug. Biosimilar infliximab is raising hopes for improving the availability of this effective treatment.

Abstract 542. Title: [Biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease].
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27711946
Abstract: After the expiry date of the patent protection for Infliximab in 2013, the biosimilar CT‑P13 was approved for indications in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adults as well as in children. The approval has been based on two randomized clinical studies indicating equivalence for the biosimilar with regard to pharmacokinetics, efficacy, as well as side-effects. The clinical experience since, in addition to multiple non-randomized studies, indicate a comparable efficacy and immunogenicity of the Infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, the introduction of the biosimilar as primary therapy seems to be justified. Tight monitoring of the safety of biosimilars with regard to efficacy and side effects has to be ensured.

Abstract 543. Title: Biological and synthetic target DMARDs in psoriatic arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31585178
Abstract: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic multi-faceted immune-mediated systemic disorder, characterized by articular, cutaneous, enthesis, nail and spine involvement. Articular manifestations of PsA are particularly common and highly disabling for patients, while the heterogeneous clinical subsets of the disease are challenging for clinicians. In recent years, research has made many advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease from genetic, epigenetic and molecular points of view. New drugs are now available for the treatment of this condition, and, in particular, TNF-alfa inhibitors, historically the first biologicals approved in PsA, are now juxtaposed by new biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) with different modes of action. Targeting IL-12/IL-23 p40 common subunit with ustekinumab, IL-17A with secukinumab and ixekizumab, T cells co-stimulation with abatacept, is now possible, safe and effective. Moreover, targeted synthetic molecules with oral administration are available, with the possibility to interfere with phosphodiesterase-4 and JAK/STAT pathways. Indeed, new drugs are under development, with the possibility to target selectively IL-17 receptor, IL-23, and other key molecular targets in the pathogenesis of this condition. In this narrative review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the current application of biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs in the field of PsA, with particular regard to the clinical significance of this possibility to target a higher number of distinct immune-pathways.

Abstract 544. Title: Market entry of biosimilar low-molecular-weight heparins in Europe: opportunities and challenges.
Publication Date: 2013-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23235959
Abstract: This article examines the market entry of biosimilar low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) in Europe by focusing on regulatory requirements, pricing, reimbursement, prescribing, and dispensing. The window for biosimilar LMWHs to enter the market is narrow on the supply side because of several factors. These include (1) regulatory requirements, including a quality dossier, clinical and nonclinical studies, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, immunogenicity studies, and a comparability exercise (but a reduction in clinical data requirements might be plausible in some cases); (2) prices of originator LMWHs are lower than those of other biologic products; (3) European prices of originator LMWHs are lower than those observed in the rest of the world; (4) research and development and manufacturing costs are substantial; (5) costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients have increased following the heparin contamination crisis; and (6) biosimilar LMWHs may be subjected to generic medicine pricing regulations. Furthermore, there are limited opportunities for biosimilar LMWHs on the demand side. This is because, although LMWHs have a large market volume in Europe, demand-side incentives for biosimilar LMWHs are largely absent, and the questions about interchangeability and substitution between originator and biosimilar LMWHs have yet to be fully resolved.

Abstract 545. Title: Clinical Outcomes Following a Switch from Remicade® to the Biosimilar CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27095751
Abstract: The biosimilar of Remicade®, CT-P13, recently entered the European market. Clinical data on switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are scarce. We aimed to prospectively investigate efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and immunogenicity following a switch from Remicade® to CT-P13 in IBD patients.
Remicade®-treated IBD patients at the Radboud university medical centre who switched to CT-P13 were included in this prospective observational cohort study. Primary endpoint was change in Harvey-Bradshaw Index for Crohn's disease [CD] and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index for ulcerative colitis [UC] at week 16. We measured C-reactive protein [CRP], faecal calprotectin [FCP], infliximab trough level [TL] and anti-drug antibodies [ADAs] and documented adverse events.
Our cohort consisted of 83 patients (28 males, 57 CD, 24 UC, 2 IBD-unclassified [IBD-U]). The median age was 36 years, range 18-79. Median change in disease activity was 0 [range -23 to +7] for CD and 0 [range -3 to +6] for UC/IBD-U. Median CRP and FCP levels did not change significantly during follow-up. Median TL increased from 3.5 µg/ml [range 0-18] to 4.2 µg/ml [range 0-21] at week 16 [p = 0.010]. Two patients developed a new detectable ADA response during follow-up and five patients discontinued CT-P13. No serious adverse events occurred.
We demonstrated that switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 in a real-life cohort of IBD patients did not have a significant impact on short-term clinical outcomes. These results suggest that switching from Remicade® to CT-P13 for the treatment of IBD is feasible.

Abstract 546. Title: Long-Term Clinical Outcomes After Switching from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to Biosimilar CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28667429
Abstract: Limited data are available on long-term clinical outcomes regarding the switch from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
To investigate long-term efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and immunogenicity.
We performed a single-center prospective observational cohort study following an elective switch from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to CT-P13 in IBD patients.
Eighty-three patients were included (57 Crohn's disease, 24 ulcerative colitis, and 2 IBD unclassified), and 68 patients completed one-year follow-up. Disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index) as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, fecal calprotectin) did not change significantly during the 1-year follow-up. In total, 7 out of 83 patients (8%) demonstrated detectable antidrug antibodies during follow-up, and 5 out of 7 antidrug antibody titers were already detectable at baseline prior to switching. Six patients (7%) discontinued CT-P13 due to adverse events.
Following a switch from Remicade<sup>®</sup> to CT-P13, 82% of IBD patients continued treatment through 1 year. Disease activity scores and inflammatory markers remained unchanged during follow-up, and no CT-P13-related serious adverse events occurred. These 1-year data suggest that switching to CT-P13 in Remicade<sup>®</sup>-treated IBD patients is safe and feasible.

Abstract 547. Title: Drug Survival and Immunogenicity After Switching From Remicade to Biosimilar CT-P13 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Two-year Follow-up of a Prospective Observational Cohort Study.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29947795
Abstract: The infliximab biosimilar has entered daily inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) practice. However, real-life outcomes beyond 1 year after switching are scarce. We aimed to investigate the long-term drug survival, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics 2 years after switching to CT-P13 in IBD patients.
We performed a single-center prospective observational cohort study in all Remicade-treated IBD patients who previously switched to CT-P13. We systematically documented reasons for discontinuation, trough levels, and antidrug antibodies to infliximab (ADAs) at baseline, week 16, week 52, and week 104. Clinical and biochemical disease activity (HBI, SCCAI, CRP) and adverse events were registered.
Eighty-three patients were enrolled, 57 had Crohn's disease, 24 had ulcerative colitis, and 2 were IBD-unclassified. At week 104, 55 of 83 (66%) patients remained on CT-P13, and 3 were lost to follow-up. Reasons for discontinuation were loss of response (n = 10), adverse events (n = 8), and disease remission (n = 7). ADAs were present in 5/83 patients at baseline (before switching), in 2 patients before week 52, and no subsequent ADAs were detected until week 104. Median trough levels and clinical and biochemical disease activity at baseline, week 16, week 52 and week 104 did not significantly change.
In a prospective cohort with >2-year follow-up, 66% of IBD patients continued CT-P13 after switching from Remicade. Two new cases with ADAs were observed in year 1, but subsequently no immunogenicity was detected. These results are reassuring and suggest that switching to CT-P13 does not impact long-term clinical outcomes. 10.1093/ibd/izy227_video1izy227.video15802479819001.

Abstract 548. Title: Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy after switching from reference infliximab to biosimilar SB2 compared with continuing reference infliximab and SB2 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: results of a randomised, double-blind, phase III transition study.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29042358
Abstract: Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity results from the phase III study of SB2, a biosimilar of reference infliximab (INF), were previously reported through 54 weeks. This transition period compared results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who switched from INF to SB2 with those in patients who maintained treatment with INF or SB2.
Patients with moderate to severe RA despite methotrexate treatment were randomised (1:1) to receive SB2 or INF at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter until week 46. At week 54, patients previously receiving INF were rerandomised (1:1) to switch to SB2 (INF/SB2 (n=94)) or to continue on INF (INF/INF (n=101)) up to week 70. Patients previously receiving SB2 continued on SB2 (SB2/SB2 (n=201)) up to week 70. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 78.
Efficacy was sustained and comparable across treatment groups. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responses between weeks 54 and 78 ranged from 63.5% to 72.3% with INF/SB2, 66.3%%-69.4% with INF/INF and 65.6%-68.3% with SB2/SB2. Treatment-emergent adverse events during this time occurred in 36.2%, 35.6% and 40.3%, respectively, and infusion-related reactions in 3.2%, 2.0% and 3.5%. Among patients who were negative for antidrug antibodies (ADA) up to week 54, newly developed ADAs were reported in 14.6%, 14.9% and 14.1% of the INF/SB2, INF/INF and SB2/SB2 groups, respectively.
The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles remained comparable among the INF/SB2, INF/INF and SB2/SB2 groups up to week 78, with no treatment-emergent issues or clinically relevant immunogenicity after switching from INF to SB2.

Abstract: Compared with the original approved biological drug on which it is based, a biosimilar has highly similar physicochemical characteristics and biological activity, as well as equivalent efficacy and no clinically meaningful differences in safety and immunogenicity. Before they are approved, biosimilars must undergo a rigorous development process using state-of-the-art technologies to establish biosimilarity to the reference biological product. After approval, biosimilars must comply with good pharmacological practices for biological drugs. Several biosimilar disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bsDMARDs) based on the tumour necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab have been approved for use in patients with rheumatic diseases. Substantial cost savings can be made if biological-naive patients begin treatment with bsDMARDs, and patients receiving original biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) are switched to bsDMARDs. Despite the consistently similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of bsDMARDs relative to their respective original bDMARDs, switching from a reference bDMARD to a bsDMARD can result in nocebo responses, such as subjective increase of disease activity and pain-related adverse events. This may have a negative impact on adherence to bsDMARDs in clinical trials and clinical practice. To ensure optimal and rational integration of bsDMARDs into rheumatology practice and realise the full cost-saving efficacy of these drugs, rheumatologists must be aware that careful communication of the cost-saving efficacy and safety of bsDMARDs to their patients is the key to a successful long-term switch to bsDMARD therapy.

Abstract 550. Title: EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: 2019 update.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969328
Abstract: To provide an update of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management recommendations to account for the most recent developments in the field.
An international task force considered new evidence supporting or contradicting previous recommendations and novel therapies and strategic insights based on two systematic literature searches on efficacy and safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) since the last update (2016) until 2019. A predefined voting process was applied, current levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned and participants ultimately voted independently on their level of agreement with each of the items.
The task force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 12 recommendations concerning use of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GCs); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, sarilumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and tapering on sustained clinical remission is provided. Cost and sequencing of b/tsDMARDs are addressed. Initially, MTX plus GCs and upon insufficient response to this therapy within 3 to 6 months, stratification according to risk factors is recommended. With poor prognostic factors (presence of autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD or JAK inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD (from another or the same class) or tsDMARD is recommended. On sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered, but not be stopped. Levels of evidence and levels of agreement were mostly high.
These updated EULAR recommendations provide consensus on the management of RA with respect to benefit, safety, preferences and cost.

Abstract 551. Title: Biosimilar switching in inflammatory bowel disease: from evidence to clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954893
Abstract: After patents' expiration of biological originators, several biosimilars of infliximab and adalimumab have been authorized. The approval is based on data extrapolated from other indications for which the originator has been previously tested. Despite rigorous approval processes by regulatory entities, physicians' and patients' knowledge about biosimilars is limited and some concerns about their use persist.
This article summarizes the evidence on efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of biosimilars currently approved in Europe for IBD treatment, by reviewing the literature on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up to mid-July 2020. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to further improve communication with patients and physicians' knowledge on biosimilars.
Adoption of biosimilars in clinical practice represents a great opportunity from an economic point of view, reducing healthcare costs and increasing patients' access to effective biologic treatments. Clinicians should be aware and confident of the latest evidence on available biosimilars and be very careful in communicating information to patients. Nocebo effect should not be overlooked since it can negatively influence outcomes of biosimilar-treated subjects, limiting the wide use of biosimilars. Evaluating the outcomes of reverse, multiple, and cross-switch will be a challenge for the next years.

Abstract 552. Title: Individual and Institutional Corruption in European and US Healthcare: Overview and Link of Various Corruption Typologies.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572725
Abstract: In recent years, the fight against healthcare corruption has intensified. Estimates from the European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network calculate an approximate €56 billion annual loss to Europe as a result of corruption. To promote understanding of the complexity and interconnection of corrupt activities, we aim to present healthcare-related corruption typologies of the European Union and European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network. We subsequently link them to the typology of individual and institutional corruption introduced by Dennis Thompson in the context of investigating misconduct of US Congressional members. According to Thompson, individual corruption is the personal gain of individuals performing duties within an institution in exchange for nurturing private interests, while institutional corruption pertains to the failure of the institution in directing the individual's behaviour towards the achievement of the institution's primary purpose because the institutional design promotes the pursuit of individual goals. Effective anti-corruption activities not only require the enactment of anti-corruption laws but also the monitoring and, where appropriate, revision of institutional frameworks to prevent the undermining of the primary purposes of health systems or institutions. To gain further understanding of the similarities and differences of the three typologies, prime examples of corrupt activities in the health sector in the European Union and USA (along with their potential remedies) are provided. Linking corruption cases to Thompson's typology revealed that many corrupt activities may show elements of both individual and institutional corruption because they are intertwined, partly overlap and may occur jointly. Hence, sanctioning individual actors only does not target the problem.

Abstract 553. Title: LBEC0101, an etanercept biosimilar for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801395
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionized by the introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. With patent expiry approaching for many expensive biologic molecules, such as etanercept, more affordable biosimilar drugs are being developed. LBEC0101 is an etanercept biosimilar approved in Japan and South Korea for all etanercept indications including RA. <b>Areas covered</b>: We discuss the pharmacological characteristics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of LBEC0101 compared with the etanercept reference product (ETN-RP). Preclinical studies showed that the binding affinity to TNFα and biological activity of LBEC0101 were similar to those of the ETN-RP. The pharmacokinetic profile of LBEC0101 was also similar to that of the ETN-RP. A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 54-week study showed that the efficacy of LBEC0101 was equivalent to that of the ETN-RP in RA patients. An extension study showed that efficacy was sustained long-term in patients receiving LBEC0101 and in those switching from the ETN-RP to LBEC0101. The safety profile of LBEC0101 was also confirmed to be comparable with the ETN-RP. <b>Expert opinion</b>: LBEC0101 has shown equivalent pharmacokinetics and efficacy and comparable safety to the ETN-RP, and the lower cost of LBEC0101 provides a good cost-benefit ratio.

Abstract 554. Title: Nocebo in Biosimilars and Generics in Neurology: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31396084
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Nocebo refers to adverse events related to patients' negative expectations and previous experiences, mediated by several neurobiological pathways within the brain. It is common among neurological patients and affects adherence and treatment outcomes, representing a real clinical challenge. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a systematic search based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines in MEDLINE database, using several keywords for studies that can be processed to investigate the magnitude of nocebo in generics and biosimilars used in the most common neurological diseases. The aim was to estimate its size and suggest strategies to minimize its prevalence in clinical trials and practice. <b>Results:</b> Of a total of 2,606 identified articles, after criteria-based selection, 35 studies were included for analysis. Overall, there was vast heterogeneity across the studies concerning population, study design, and outcomes. Nocebo response could be estimated only in one double-blind randomized trial of generic glatiramer acetate in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that included a placebo arm. In this trial, no significant differences observed between the three arms (innovator, bioequivalent, and placebo) in favorable and unfavorable outcomes. In the open-label phase of the trial, an increased withdrawal rate was recorded in patients switched from placebo to bioequivalent (8.4%) that may be related to nocebo. In other open-label and real-world studies evaluating biosimilars or generics for brain disorders, a similar indirect nocebo effect is assuming by several investigators. Also, knowledge gaps between health-care providers and patients exist towards generics and biosimilars. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite its presence, the true burden of the nocebo response and effect cannot be accurately estimated in existing studies with generics and biosimilars in neurological diseases. Targeted strategies for clinical trials' design are needed in order to measure the exact nocebo's size.

Abstract 555. Title: Biologics, Pharmacovigilance, and Patient Safety: It's All in the Name.
Publication Date: 2016-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27459655
Abstract: The most appropriate naming convention for biologics and biosimilars has been an area of significant debate. The ultimate decision will have an impact on patient safety, pharmacovigilance program effectiveness, and, potentially, the overall adoption of biosimilars in the United States. This article reviews some of the advantages and disadvantages of various naming approaches. For clarity in communication, optimal pharmacovigilance, and patient safety, it is recommended that biosimilars be named with a common USAN (United States Adopted Name) with the reference product, along with a suffix that is memorable, such as one associated with the original manufacturer of the product. This approach supports the FDA's mission of protecting patient safety and public health, while minimizing the possibility of inadvertent switching of products and facilitating effective pharmacovigilance.

Abstract 556. Title: Biosimilars: Practical Considerations for Pharmacists.
Publication Date: 2017-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28176529
Abstract: To review the scientific and regulatory aspects of biosimilar development and practical considerations for the use of biosimilars that are relevant to pharmacists.
Literature searches of PubMed and congress abstracts for publications pertaining to biosimilars were conducted from January 2016 to January 2017. Individual drug company web pages and governmental, regulatory, and other agency websites were also reviewed.
Published articles, regulatory guidelines, and other sources covering biologic/biosimilar development and approval, reporting results of biosimilar studies or survey research, and/or identifying biosimilars in development or approved for use in Europe or the United States were reviewed and included.
Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases, including hematological or autoimmune disorders and cancers. A biosimilar is highly similar to a licensed biologic (ie, reference or originator) and has no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics are large, complex proteins that cannot be exactly replicated, so the concept of a generic equivalent cannot be applied to biologics. Regulatory agencies have provided a framework for biosimilar approval, but there are many practical considerations for pharmacists, including interchangeability, substitution, naming, indication extrapolation, product labeling, therapeutic drug monitoring, manufacturer attributes, logistics of product use, and reimbursement.
Pharmacists will play a key role in managing the introduction of biosimilars into health care systems. Understanding the principles of biosimilar development and evolving regulatory guidelines relevant to their use will allow pharmacists to make informed decisions regarding formulary inclusion and educate patients and other health care providers about biosimilars.

Abstract 557. Title: Comparative Safety of Originator and Biosimilar Epoetin Alfa Drugs: An Observational Prospective Multicenter Study.
Publication Date: 2018-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30030767
Abstract: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are biological molecules approved for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Biosimilars were licensed for use in Europe in 2007.
This study aimed to compare the safety profile of biosimilars with respect to the reference product in a nephrology setting.
A prospective study was conducted in four Italian regions between 1 October 2013 and 30 June 2015. The study population included patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing hemodialysis and treated with epoetins as per the clinical practice of the participating centers. The two comparison cohorts included patients treated with either an originator or a biosimilar epoetin alfa. Each patient was followed up until occurrence of any safety outcome of interest (grouped into three major categories), switch to a different ESA product, transplant or peritoneal dialysis, death, or end of the study period, whichever came first.
Overall, 867 subjects were included in the study (originator: N = 423; biosimilar: N = 444). Biosimilar users were older than originator users (median age of 76 vs 64 years, respectively), more frequently affected by arrhythmia (29.3 vs 22.5%), and less frequently candidates for transplantation (3.8 vs 18.2%). Cox-regression analysis showed no increase in risk of safety outcomes in biosimilar users, even after adjusting for confounding factors: 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.3) for any outcomes; 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.8) for problems related to dialysis device; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for cardio- and cerebro-vascular conditions; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for infections.
This study confirms the comparable safety profiles of originator and biosimilar epoetin alfa drugs when used in patients receiving dialysis.

Abstract 559. Title: Comparison of Rituximab originator (MabThera) to biosimilar (Truxima) in patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919938
Abstract: Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an acute, multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy mediated by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) autoantibodies. Immunosuppression with anti-CD20 therapy is the mainstay of treatment. MabThera's patent has now expired and biosimilars have been approved. Eighty-four consecutive patient episodes over 2 years, prior to and following our switch to Truxima are presented. Day 1 (D1), Day 28 (D28) and 3-month platelet counts, ADAMTS13 activity, and CD19 levels, adverse reactions and infective complications were recorded. Platelet counts were not significantly different between acute MabThera and Truxima treatment (D1 P = 0.085, D28 P = 0.77, 3 months P = 0.71) and electively (D1 P = 0.79, D28 P = 0.68, 3 months P = 0.99). ADAMTS13 recovery also was not significantly different acutely (D1 P = 0.99, D28 P = 0.27, 3 months P = 0.26) and electively (D1 P = 0.59, D28 P = 0.61, 3 months P = 0.34). CD19% depletion at D1 and 3 months was not significantly different acutely (D1 P = 0.52, 3 months P = 0.56) and electively (D1 P = 0.22, 3 months P = 0.19). Infusion reactions and infective complications were comparable with both therapies. This is the first series of the Rituximab biosimilar Truxima to be reported in iTTP, demonstrating equivalence to MabThera in terms of ADAMTS13 recovery, CD19 depletion, and platelet count at D28 and 3 months post-administration, with comparable infusion and infective complications. The financial benefit of the biosimilar anti-CD20 is considerable.

Abstract 560. Title: Pharmaceutical development of biologics: fundamentals, challenges and recent advances.
Publication Date: 2011-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22833901
Abstract: The 46th Arden Conference, held in West Point, NY, USA, March 2011, focused on development of protein therapeutics, comprising preformulation, formulation, manufacturing, advanced delivery systems, protein characterization/analysis, and regulatory landscape. The sessions of preformulation and formulation development consisted of nine lectures discussing protein stability implications and characterization during purification, freeze-drying and manufacturing. The session on advanced drug delivery encompassed two new sustained-release microsphere formulations (protein microencapsulation by annealing of premade porous PLGA microspheres and aqueous-aqueous emulsion for preformulating proteins to solvent-resistant particles), two transdermal insulins (patching after thermal ablation of skin and phase-transition hydrogel microneedle patch), and a responsible hydrogel system for intra-ear delivery. The sessions on analytical technologies and regulatory landscape both focused on challenges for biosimilars.

Abstract 562. Title: Biosimilar medicines.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31157111
Abstract: Biological medicines have become indispensable in the treatment of patients with serious diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. Biosimilars are medicines which are developed to be similar to existing biological medicines (the 'reference product'). For the European market, they are approved by the European Medicines Agency. Owing to the rising importance of biosimilar medicines, the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (EAHP) decided to set out its position on key issues concerning biosimilar medicines in a position paper. The topics included the role of hospital pharmacists in the uptake of biosimilar medicines in healthcare with regard to selection, procurement, logistics, information, education and collecting real-life experience (eg, in monitoring and pharmacovigilance). In addition, the paper touches on the views of the association for the naming of biosimilar medicines, extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, switching and substitution of biosimilar medicines and the provision of information about biosimilar medicines.

Abstract 563. Title: Assessing gastroenterologist and patient acceptance of biosimilars in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease across Germany.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28410403
Abstract: This study examined gastroenterologists' motivation for prescribing biosimilars, assessed their treatment preferences in relation to prescribing behaviour, and explored patient attitudes to biosimilars.
Data were taken from the Adelphi Real World Biosimilars Programme, a real-world, cross-sectional study undertaken in 2015-2016 with German gastroenterologists and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Gastroenterologists provided data on their prescribing behaviour and attitudes towards biosimilars, and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a detailed questionnaire. For analysis, gastroenterologists were split into 'Investigative', 'Conservative', and 'Other' groups.
Overall, 25 gastroenterologists and 136 patients participated. Biosimilars accounted for <15% of all biologic therapies and >80% of gastroenterologists would prescribe a bio-originator rather than biosimilar as 1st line therapy if unrestricted. Patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, although of those receiving biosimilars, 79% were satisfied with the current treatment of their condition, and 69% were satisfied with the control of symptoms. Although at least 35% of patients in each analysis group reported no concerns when starting treatment with a bio-originator or biosimilar, 41% of previously biologic-naïve patients prescribed a biosimilar indicated potential side effects and potential long-term problems, and 24% not knowing enough about the drug, as concerns.
Results demonstrate that there is reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to further educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. There remains a need for further research into non-clinical switching and the long term impact of prescribing biosimilars.

Abstract 564. Title: Potential cost savings from chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia with biosimilar filgrastim and expanded access to targeted antineoplastic treatment across the European Union G5 countries: a simulation study.
Publication Date: 2015-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25704107
Abstract: The objectives of this study were to simulate for the European Union G5 countries the potential cost savings of converting patients from originator granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) filgrastim and pegfilgrastim to a biosimilar filgrastim, to evaluate how reallocating these savings could increase patient access to antineoplastic therapy, and to estimate the number of patients needed to convert to provide antineoplastic treatment to one patient.
Three models were built: (1) to estimate the costs of using originator G-CSFs and the savings generated from switching to a biosimilar G-CSF, (2) to estimate the incremental number of patients who could be provided antineoplastic therapy-rituximab or trastuzumab-in a hypothetical panel of 10,000 patients with cancer, and (3) to calculate the number of patients needed to convert to provide access to anticancer therapy. Scenarios were developed in which the rate of conversion was varied to estimate the effect on total cost savings. This study took the perspective of the payer in the European Union.
The savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over the originator filgrastim ranged from €785 (day 4) to €2747 (day 14) and increased with longer duration of therapy. By contrast, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over pegfilgrastim decreased over time, ranging from €6199 (day 4) to €471 (day 14). In a hypothetical panel of 10,000 patients with cancer, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over the originator filgrastim and the expanded access to antineoplastic therapy improved over time, irrespective of conversion rates. Conversely, in the same hypothetical panel, the savings associated with the biosimilar filgrastim over pegfilgrastim reduced over time, irrespective of conversion rates, along with the expanded access to antineoplastic treatment. Under conversion of the originator filgrastim to the biosimilar filgrastim, the number needed to convert to expand access to rituximab ranged from 4 to 14 patients, and the number needed to convert to expand access to trastuzumab ranged from 11 to 38 patients. Under conversion of pegfilgrastim to the biosimilar filgrastim, the number needed to convert to expand access to rituximab ranged from 2 to 24 patients, and the number needed to convert to expand access to trastuzumab ranged from 5 to 63 patients.
Use of biosimilar G-CSFs for supportive cancer care could yield potential cost savings and improve patient access to antineoplastic therapy in a budget neutral way-a financial effect with an ethical perspective.

Abstract 566. Title: Treatment satisfaction, safety, and effectiveness of biosimilar insulin glargine is comparable in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after switching from insulin glargine or insulin degludec: a post-marketing safety study.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030354
Abstract: To evaluate insulin treatment satisfaction, safety, and effectiveness of biosimilar insulin glargine (GLY) in real-world clinical practice for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who switched from originator insulin glargine (100 U/mL) or insulin degludec treatment to GLY treatment.
The Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) was used to assess treatment satisfaction in a subgroup analysis of a post-marketing safety study. Hypoglycemia incidence rates and blood glucose control are also reported during the 12-month observation period for GLY-switched patients.
Of 1104 patients with T2DM enrolled to participate, 565 patients switched from either insulin glargine U100/mL (<i>n</i> = 470) or insulin degludec (<i>n</i> = 95) to GLY. The mean total change from baseline to 3 months for total ITSQ score was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.13 to 2.83, <i>p</i> = .073) for patients who switched from insulin glargine and 2.63 (95% CI -1.43 to 6.70, <i>p</i> = .195) for patients who switched from insulin degludec to GLY treatment. The mean change from baseline to 12 months in hypoglycemia events reported per month was -0.04% (95% CI -0.12 to 0.03, <i>p</i> = .236) for patients who switched from insulin glargine and no change for patients who switched from insulin degludec (0.00, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.20, <i>p</i> = 1.000). Non-significant mean changes from baseline to 12 months were observed for hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose in GLY-switched patients.
Treatment satisfaction does not change significantly in Japanese patients with T2DM who switch to GLY from the reference product or from insulin degludec. Safety and effectiveness over a 12-month period were similar in GLY-treated patients who switched from either insulin glargine or insulin degludec.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33706664
Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilars compared with reference biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a part of the process of developing the 2020 update of the Japan College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of RA.
PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Japan Centra Revuo Medicina were searched for articles to conduct a systematic review (SR). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.
Twenty randomized controlled trials were included (biosimilars of infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab). A meta-analysis revealed that the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of achieving the American College of Rheumatology 50% response (ACR50) at week 24 and serious adverse events (SAEs) for biosimilars compared with the reference bDMARDs were 1.04 (0.98-1.10) and 0.84 (0.61-1.18), respectively. The RRs of achieving ACR50 and SAEs at week 24 were respectively 0.93 (0.69-1.26) and 2.15 (0.55-8.35) in the patients who switched to biosimilars from the reference bDMARDs and 0.92 (0.76-1.12) and 1.41 (0.32-6.15) in those who continued the reference bDMARDs.
Biosimilars and reference bDMARDs were equally useful for the management of RA.

Abstract 568. Title: Safety and efficacy of CT-P13 in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis in an extension phase or after switching from infliximab.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27586879
Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the safety of CT-P13 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during long-term treatment or after switching from innovator infliximab (IFX).
Patients who completed 54 weeks of treatment in a phase I/II study (PI/II) received CT-P13 at an initial dose of 3 mg/kg at Week 62, with dose increases permitted up to 10 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was adverse event (AE) incidence.
Thirty-four of 38 patients in the maintenance group and 29 of 33 in the switch group reported at least one AE. Safety profiles in both groups were similar to those in PI/II. Eleven of 28 patients who were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at Week 62 discontinued the study before Week 110. Forty-one of 43 ADA-negative patients remained negative, and 10 of 28 ADA-positive patients became negative during the study. The mean DAS28 (ESR) at Week 134 was 3.166 in the maintenance group and 3.955 in the switch group.
CT-P13 was well tolerated in patients who maintained the treatment after 54 weeks and in patients who switched to CT-P13 after 54 weeks of IFX treatment. The study also demonstrated a stable clinical efficacy of CT-P13 in RA patients.

Abstract 569. Title: Costs associated with non-medical switching from originator to biosimilar etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the UK.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31373527
Abstract: <b>Aims:</b> To estimate the cost impact of non-medical switching from originator to biosimilar etanercept in stable patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the UK. <b>Materials and methods:</b> A cohort-based decision tree model was developed with a 1-year time horizon. The model population included patients with stable RA (patients who responded to originator etanercept treatment with no treatment changes in the previous 6 months). Patients could undergo a non-medical switch to a biosimilar and then switch treatment again, if medically required, after 3-6 months. Data on the proportion of patients switching therapies, baseline healthcare resource use, and impact of switching on resource use were sourced from a survey of 150 rheumatologists from EU5 markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). The average impact of switching was evaluated as mean values for change in resource utilization due to switching. Also, low- and high-impact scenarios (lower and upper values of the 95% confidence intervals for change in resource utilization due to switching) were modelled as sensitivity analyses. Cost data came from published UK sources. <b>Results:</b> The model assumed that 5,000 patients were treated with originator etanercept, with 1,259 (25.2%) switching to a biosimilar. Of those, 875 (69.5%) and 384 (30.5%) switched to SB4 and GP2015, respectively. After 3 months, 26.3% of patients who switched treatments did so again: 8.3% back to originator, 3.8% to the other biosimilar, and 14.2% to another biologic. Although originator etanercept was more expensive than the biosimilars, switching was more costly than continuous originator treatment across all impact scenarios. Switching treatment chains had higher overall annual per-patient costs than continuous originator treatment. Switching was associated with increased healthcare resource use. <b>Limitations:</b> Results from this analysis are not transferable to other (non-RA) etanercept indications. <b>Conclusion:</b> Non-medical switching can result in increased payer costs because of increased healthcare resource use following switching.

Abstract 570. Title: Physician attitudes about non-medical switching to biosimilars: results from an online physician survey in the United States.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712393
Abstract: This study was designed to understand the level of familiarity of US rheumatologists, gastroenterologists and dermatologists with biosimilar therapies, their experience with non-medical switching (switching medications for reasons unrelated to patient health) of patients between biologics and their attitudes towards switching from a biologic to a biosimilar.
A total of 297 US physicians who currently prescribe biologics for their patients completed a 15-minute online survey. Rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists were included.
The majority of physicians (84%) did not want stable patients undergoing a non-medical switch to a biosimilar. While 60% of physicians believed non-medical switching to biosimilars may have a positive impact on healthcare system costs, multiple negative impacts were also expected. A majority of physicians anticipated a negative impact on patient mental health (59%), treatment efficacy (57%), patient safety (53%) and physician office management (60%).
The majority of physicians had concerns regarding non-medical switching to biosimilars and the impact such switching would have on patient care and physician practice.

Abstract 571. Title: Patient attitudes about non-medical switching to biosimilars: results from an online patient survey in the United States.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30618353
Abstract: To evaluate patient attitudes regarding non-medical switching (NMS) to biosimilars among patients with autoimmune disease currently receiving a biologic.
An online survey was conducted among patients meeting the following criteria: ≥18 years of age; residing in the US; diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis; currently taking a biologic; and consenting to participate. Patients answered questions about their attitudes and experiences related to NMS. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses.
A total of 1696 patients completed the 20-min survey. Eighty-five per cent of patients were concerned that biosimilars wouldn't treat their disease as well; 85% didn't want to switch to a biosimilar if their current biologic was helping their disease; and 83% were concerned that switching may cause more side-effects. Twenty per cent of patients had previously received notification about a potential NMS to another biologic (that was not a biosimilar) from their insurance company. Of these, 79% took at least one action to avoid the NMS and 45% ultimately switched. Of these patients (n = 150), 67% indicated that their previous biologic worked well for them and 70% didn't want to switch to another biologic. Most patients who switched (67%) did so to avoid paying a higher cost. More than half (56%) went without therapy for administrative reasons during the period of transition from the old biologic to the other treatment.
Patients reported multiple concerns about NMS that might impact treatment outcomes, and many of the patients who non-medically switched in this survey missed treatments. Future studies should be conducted on patient expectations and experiences with NMS to understand the impact on healthcare delivery, treatment persistency, and patient outcomes. The patient perspective and experience should be considered by decision-makers when developing coverage policies for biosimilar medications and associated communication strategies.

Abstract 572. Title: Switching from Epoetin Alfa (Epogen®) to Epoetin Alfa-Epbx (RetacritTM) Using a Specified Dosing Algorithm: A Randomized, Non-Inferiority Study in Adults on Hemodialysis.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30196301
Abstract: For patients with anemia undergoing hemodialysis, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are typically dosed via precise algorithms. Using one such algorithm, we assessed the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in patients switched from epoetin alfa reference product (Epogen®) to epoetin alfa-epbx (RetacritTM; a biosimilar to US-licensed Epogen®/Procrit®).
This randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study was conducted at Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) hemodialysis centers. Patients with anemia and chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and receiving routine intravenous (IV) Epogen® were randomized 1: 1 to switch to IV RetacritTM or continue standard-of-care (Epogen®) for 24 weeks, using analogous versions of the FMCNA ESA-dosing algorithm. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time patients' hemoglobin was 9-11 g/dL during weeks 17-24.
Of 432 randomized patients, 418 received treatment (RetacritTM, n = 212; standard-of-care, n = 206) and comprised the full analysis set. A similar proportion of patients discontinued from each arm. The proportion of time patients' hemoglobin was within the target range was 61.9% (95% CI 57.5-66.2) in the RetacritTM arm and 63.3% (95% CI 58.7-67.7) in the standard-of-care arm. The difference in proportions between treatment arms was -1.4% (95% CI -7.6 to 4.9), and the lower bound of the confidence interval was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -12.5%. There was no statistically significant difference between arms in the mean change from baseline in the weekly mean ESA dose during weeks 17-24, and no clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes.
Switching to RetacritTM was non-inferior to continuing -Epogen® in maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients receiving hemodialysis, when both ESAs were dosed using a specified algorithm (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504294).

Abstract 573. Title: Introduction of biosimilar pegfilgrastim in France: Economic analysis of switching from originator.
Publication Date: 2021-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33019875
Abstract: To assess the economic impact of introducing biosimilar pegfilgrastim compared to the current standard granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) practice in France.
A budget impact model was developed to investigate the impact of introducing pegfilgrastim biosimilar over 5 years. The model analysed drug acquisition costs, ambulatory costs, as well as costs associated with poor outcomes, and compared the current standard practice of long-acting and short-acting G-CSF to a revised practice including pegfilgrastim biosimilar in addition to standard practice treatments. The cost of switching to pegfilgrastim biosimilar, within a pharmacy setting, was analysed within the model using data from a survey of French pharmacists.
The budget impact model calculated a cost saving of €51,007,531 over 5 years switching from the current standard practice to pegfilgrastim biosimilar. A sensitivity analysis accounting for variation in pegfilgrastim biosimilar uptake of 1) 15% in year 1 and 1% in years 2-5 and 2) 15% in years 1-5, estimated savings ranging between €29,377,784 and €79,847,194, respectively. A further analysis predicted cost savings of €287,344,835 over 5 years with the extension of pegfilgrastim biosimilar, at an uptake of 15% in year 1 and 7% in years 2-4, to both long-acting and short-acting G-CSF groups compared to unchanged current practice.
The introduction of pegfilgrastim biosimilar will help to reduce cost and alleviate some of the financial pressure on the French healthcare system.

Abstract 574. Title: Medication safety risks to be managed in national implementation of automatic substitution of biological medicines: a qualitative study.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-28
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31662405
Abstract: To explore relevant Finnish stakeholders' perceptions on the automatic substitution of biological medicines with particular focus on medication safety and issues that need to be considered to create an appropriate model for automatic biological product substitution.
Qualitative interview study.
Data were collected in semistructured individual (n=17), pair (n=7) and group (n=8) interviews (32 interviews, 62 participants) in 2018. Participants represented a wide range of stakeholders involved in the pharmacotherapy process: community pharmacists (n=8 interviews), authorities (n=7), prescribers (n=7), pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers (n=6), patients/customers (n=2), hospital pharmacists (n=1) and nurses (n=1). Inductive content analysis was performed.
Benefits of automatic substitution were identified as cost savings, more patients receiving biological treatments and enhanced continuity of treatment. Six major risk categories were identified: (1) the patient's medication is interrupted or complicated temporarily or permanently, (2) the patient uses two products with the same active substance, (3) the traceability of the product is compromised, (4) the patient cannot get into healthcare in case of problems, (5) the patient does not receive substitution-related advice from a pharmacy and (6) the patient is distracted by the support material he/she receives. Several risk mitigation measures were commonly mentioned: medication and device counselling by pharmacists (n=23), infrequent substitution interval (n=15) and better knowledge on biosimilars among healthcare providers (n=13).
Automatic substitution of biologics is associated with risks that should be prospectively managed before implementing the procedure. The substitution also introduces new tasks and communication needs to those involved in actual medication use process, particularly to community pharmacists who will be responsible for substitution and counselling the patients.

Abstract 575. Title: Statistical and regulatory considerations in assessments of interchangeability of biological drug products.
Publication Date: 2014-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24832831
Abstract: When the patent of a brand-name, marketed drug expires, new, generic products are usually offered. Small-molecule generic and originator drug products are expected to be chemically identical. Their pharmaceutical similarity can be typically assessed by simple regulatory criteria such as the expectation that the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of some pharmacokinetic parameters be between 0.80 and 1.25. When such criteria are satisfied, the drug products are generally considered to exhibit therapeutic equivalence. They are then usually interchanged freely within individual patients. Biological drugs are complex proteins, for instance, because of their large size, intricate structure, sensitivity to environmental conditions, difficult manufacturing procedures, and the possibility of immunogenicity. Generic and brand-name biologic products can be expected to show only similarity but not identity in their various features and clinical effects. Consequently, the determination of biosimilarity is also a complicated process which involves assessment of the totality of the evidence for the close similarity of the two products. Moreover, even when biosimilarity has been established, it may not be assumed that the two biosimilar products can be automatically substituted by pharmacists. This generally requires additional, careful considerations. Without declaring interchangeability, a new product could be prescribed, i.e. it is prescribable. However, two products can be automatically substituted only if they are interchangeable. Interchangeability is a statistical term and it means that products can be used in any order in the same patient without considering the treatment history. The concepts of interchangeability and prescribability have been widely discussed in the past but only in relation to small molecule generics. In this paper we apply these concepts to biosimilars and we discuss: definitions of prescribability and interchangeability and their statistical implementation; the relation between bioequivalence and interchangeability for small-molecule drug products; regulatory requirements and expectations of biosimilar products in various jurisdictions; possible statistical approaches to establish the similarity and interchangeability of biologic drug products; definition of other technical terms such as switchability and automatic substitution. The paper will be concluded with a discussion of the anticipated future use of interchangeability of biological drug products.

Abstract 576. Title: Interchangeability of biosimilar and biological reference product: updated regulatory positions and pre- and post-marketing evidence.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29186988
Abstract: Since 2006, biosimilars have been available in several countries worldwide, thus allowing for potential savings in pharmaceutical expenditure. However, there have been numerous debates about the interchangeability of biosimilars and reference products based on concerns of immunogenicity by switching between biological products, which may cause lack of effect and toxicity.
The authors provide the reader with an overview of the different positions of regulatory authorities on the interchangeability and automatic substitution of biosimilars and reference products. Presently, the FDA allows automatic substitution without prescriber intervention if the biosimilar is interchangeable with reference products, while the European Medicines Agency delegate to each single EU member state.
Different approaches in defining interchangeability and automatic substitution call for harmonization to increase confidence of healthcare professionals and patients about the clinical impact of switching. Networks of electronic healthcare records and administrative databases, potentially linkable to clinical charts and registries may rapidly assess frequency and benefit-risk profile of different switching patterns in routine care at different levels, thus integrating and strengthening pre-marketing evidence.

Abstract 578. Title: [Equivalence, equity and evidence for the use of biosimilar drugs.].
Publication Date: 2017-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28151523
Abstract: At present, biosimilar drugs are one of the potential tools capable to allow the access to biological pharmacotherapy in a context of limited resources. Even though universal standards have been determined, prescribers are often unaware of the meaning of the evaluation which assures correct equivalence of biosimilar with the originator product. On the other hand, comparative efficacy and safety studies between biosimilars and originators are often lacking. These might be some of the limiting factors for a wider use of such therapeutic tools by the health practitioners. As a consequence, skepticism and potential legal issues are dominating the scientific discussion on this topic hindering the discussion on clinical issues related to the use of biosimilars (e.g, switching's safety; head to head effectiveness data versus originators, etc.). To overcome existing barriers, the Committee for Medicines of the Lazio Region established a specific pathway in order to share with researchers and practitioners the available evidence as well as to investigate the hypothesis of efficacy and safety differences using real world data. This might represent a novel approach to transfer the right information in the clinical practice. However, to improve the correct use of biosimilar drugs we need to develop new strategies taking into account national and international best practices capable to involve all stakeholders.

Abstract 579. Title: Outcomes after double switching from originator Infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 and biosimilar SB2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a 12-month prospective cohort study.
Publication Date: 2021-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33647174
Abstract: There are few data regarding multiple switching from the originator Infliximab to its biosimilars.
To assess outcomes and patient perspectives in a prospective manner after double switching from Infliximab to the biosimilars CT-P13 and SB2.
A total of 158 consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving CT-P13 maintenance therapy were switched to SB2 and followed for 54 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous switch from the originator Infliximab to CT-P13 (double switch group) or not (single switch group).
The drug persistence was high (94.9%) after 54 weeks. In total, 17 (10.8%) patients experienced loss of response to SB2, including 10 patients who were managed through dose optimisation and continued treatment. No changes were observed in clinical activity scores, fatigue, biological activity and pharmacokinetical parameters after the switch. The safety profile was in line with the current knowledge of Infliximab. According to the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the patients' perspectives did not change after switching from CT-P13 to SB2. The primary patient concerns remained after the switch, which were focused on effectiveness and safety rather than on the molecular differences between originator and biosimilars or socioeconomic benefits. There were also no differences in the concerns and beliefs between the double and single switch groups.
Double switching from the originator Infliximab to CT-P13 and then to SB2 was not associated with an impairment in patient beliefs, while the effectiveness, immunogeniity and safety of anti-TNF therapy remained stable after 54 weeks of follow-up.

Abstract 580. Title: A budget impact analysis of the introduction of erythropoiesis stimulating agent subsequent entry biologics for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease in Canada.
Publication Date: 2014-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25780617
Abstract: In Europe, epoetin subsequent entry biologics (SEBs) have been in use since 2007. Canadian patents of erythropoietin stimulating agents are expiring in 2014, therefore it is predicted that epoetin SEBs will penetrate the Canadian market in the near future.
To estimate the economic impact and costs offsets associated with the uptake and use of one or more epoetin SEBs in Canada for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease.
A Canada-wide epidemiological-based budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate cost outcomes under two scenarios: with and without the availability of epoetin SEB.
The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare payer, over a 5-year time horizon from 2015 to 2019.
Patients included in the model were those with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5, who have renal anemia and require treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents.
Only direct medical costs pertaining to drug acquisition of currently available erythropoietin stimulating agents in Canada were incorporated in the model. Cost of epoetin SEBs, market shares, uptake rates, and other model inputs were estimated from published sources or databases. No discounting of future costs was applied.
Based on our analysis, under market phenomena similar to those seen in the Europe and without considering potential switching from originator epoetin to epoetin SEB, we could expect that Canadian adoption of epoetin SEBs could result in $35 million (2013 CAD, year 1) to $50 million (year 5) cost savings annually, with cumulative savings of $221 million after 5 years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, model variables with substantial impact on cost savings were the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and epoetin SEB uptake rates.
We did not take into account costs associated with overhead, administration, or adverse events.
The advent of SEBs represents an opportunity to relieve financial pressure in our healthcare system. Under the assumption that the efficacy and safety of epoetin SEBs are non-inferior to originator products, we have shown that the adoption of epoetin SEBs can lead to cost savings for the Canadian payer.

Abstract 581. Title: Development and regulation of biosimilars: current status and future challenges.
Publication Date: 2013-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23553340
Abstract: Biologic medicinal products developed via rDNA technology as recombinant protein-based medicines that have been in clinical use since the early 1980s as original biopharmaceuticals have greatly contributed to the therapy of severe metabolic and degenerative diseases. The recent expiration of the data protection or patents for most of them created opportunities for the development of copy versions of original biopharmaceuticals with similar biologic activity (termed biosimilars). Production of these new products is expected to meet worldwide demand, promote market competition, maintain the incentives for innovation, and sustain the healthcare systems. The licencing of these products, however, relies on the experience gained with the original biopharmaceuticals. Critical issues related to this class of medicinal products include their terminology (to avoid confusion with generics and non-innovator copy versions that have not been tested according to the biosimilar guidelines), manufacturing, and regulation. The European Union (EU) has been the first to establish a regulatory framework for marketing authorization application (MAA) and has named these products biosimilars, a term also recently adopted by the US FDA. Unlike the conventional, more common small molecular weight human medicines and chemical generics, protein-based medicines exhibit higher molecular weight, complexity in structure and function that can be affected by changes in the manufacturing process. Therefore, biosimilars represent a relatively heterogeneous class of medicinal products that make their regulation quite challenging. According to the current understanding in the EU, a biosimilar is a copy version of an already authorized biopharmaceutical (or reference product) with similar biologic activity, physicochemical characteristics, efficacy, and safety, based on a full comparability exercise at quality, preclinical and clinical level to ensure similar efficacy and safety. Guidance has been provided through several Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidelines as well as individual scientific advice requested from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by various companies for the development and regulation of biosimilars. This review is mainly focused on the current status of regulation of biosimilars in the EU as well as on future challenges lying ahead for the improvement of the requirements needed for the marketing authorization of biosimilars. Emphasis is given on the quality requirements concerning these medicinal products (biologics).

Abstract 582. Title: Effectiveness and safety of infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 in treating ulcerative colitis: a real‑life experience in IBD primary centers.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28293938
Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of infliximab biosimilar (IFX) IFX CT-P13 in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) outpatients in Italian primary gastroenterology centers.
Patients were prospectively assessed at entry, after 8, 12, 24, 36, and therefore 52 weeks. Clinical activity was rated as per the Mayo Score. The primary endpoint was reaching of clinical remission (Mayo Score ≤2). Several secondary endpoints were clinical response to treatment, reaching of mucosal healing (MH), safety of the drug.
Twenty-nine patients (16 males and 13 females, mean age 45 years, range 35-42 years) were enrolled. Eleven (37.9%) patients had previous exposure to other anti-TNF-α. Clinical remission was present in 78.5% at week 24, and in 100% at 12-month follow-up. Subgroup analysis did not reveal significant differences in clinical remission between IFX-naïve patients and patients switching from originator to IFX biosimilar. A clinical response was observed in 92.3% at week 8, in 50.0% at week 16, in 100% at week 36 and in 100% at 12-month follow-up. MH occurred in 85.7% at week 24, and in 100% at 12-month follow-up Reduction of steroids was achieved in 92.3% at week 8, and in 100% during follow-up. One patient underwent proctocolectomy 3 weeks after starting IFX CT-P13. The median C-reactive protein and calprotectin levels during follow-up were significantly reduced during follow-up. No adverse events were observed during follow-up.
IFX CT-P13 seems to be very effective and safe in real-life experience at primary IBD centers.

Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31263362
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab (IFX) CT-P13 in treating outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Italian primary gastroenterology centers.
Consecutive IBD outpatients who completed the induction treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Clinical activity was scored according to the Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC) and to the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for Crohn's disease (CD). The primary endpoint was the achievement of clinical remission (Mayo score ≤2 in UC and HBI ≤5 in CD). Secondary endpoints were clinical response to treatment, achievement of mucosal healing, and safety.
One hundred forty-one patients (96 UC and 45 CD) were enrolled. Previous treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α had been provided to 26% of UC patients and 28.9% of CD patients. Remission was achieved in 57.3% UC patients and in 75.6% CD patients during a median (interquartile range) follow up of 24 (6-24) months. Clinical response and mucosal healing were achieved in 87.5% and 75.0% of UC patients and in 84.4% and 84.2% of CD patients, respectively. By both univariate and multivariate analysis, age >40 years, presence of comorbidities, and naivety to anti-TNFα were significantly related to remission. Only one (0.7%) adverse event was reported in the CD group. Surgery was performed in 2.1% of UC patients and 6.7% of CD patients. Switching from IFX originator to biosimilar did not influence the maintenance of the clinical remission.
This study confirmed the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P13 therapy in IBD, in both naïve patients and those switching from IFX originator.

Abstract 584. Title: Reviewing the evidence for biosimilars: key insights, lessons learned and future horizons.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28903542
Abstract: Biologic therapies have become central to the long-term management of many chronic diseases, including inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Over recent years, the development and licensing pathways for biosimilars have become more standardized, and several biosimilars have been made available for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as RA. Pre-licensing requirements for biosimilars mandate the demonstration of comparability with reference products in terms of clinical activity, safety and immunogenicity, whereas post-marketing surveillance and risk minimization requirements are set in place to ensure that long-term, real-world safety data are collected to assess biosimilars in clinical practice. These measures should provide a foundation for physician confidence in biosimilars, which can be established further through clinical experience. Biosimilars may help to fill an unmet need by improving patient access to effective biologic treatments for chronic diseases. Greater access may result in additional clinical benefits, with appropriate use of biologic therapies according to treatment guidelines being associated with improved outcomes and the potential for reduced costs of care. Key challenges for the integration of biosimilars into everyday practice include questions about interchangeability, switching and automatic substitution. Several switching studies have shown that biosimilars can be used in place of reference products while maintaining efficacy and safety. Additional ongoing studies and registries may help to optimize the process of switching, and different funding models are examining the optimal mechanisms to ensure effective uptake of these new treatments.

Abstract 585. Title: Concepts and Challenges of Biosimilars in Breast Cancer: The Emergence of Trastuzumab Biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-25
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30257528
Abstract: With the development of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab-based therapy has become the standard of care among patients with early or advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. However, real-world data have shown that up to a half of patients do not receive trastuzumab or any other HER2-targeted agent, mainly due to high treatments costs. The prospect of a more enlarged access to trastuzumab treatment lies in the use of biosimilars, as the European and the US patent of the reference products has or will soon expire. Biosimilars are biologics highly similar in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy to already approved biologics. The biosimilarity of any European Union (EU)-approved biosimilar is guaranteed based on the comprehensive comparability exercise which includes comparative analytical, non-clinical and clinical studies. In the matter of biosimilars' interchangeability and substitution, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have adopted different positions, triggering various discussions on the potential immunogenicity and efficacy in individual patients. As more biosimilars are gaining approval, the present review aims to offer concise information for oncologists and pharmacists about the production, approval, interchangeability, and substitution policies of biosimilars used in breast cancer therapy, with a special focus on trastuzumab.

Abstract 586. Title: Efficacy of infliximab as a switched biologic in rheumatoid arthritis patients in daily clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30632931
Abstract: To assess the efficacy and safety of switching to infliximab (IFX) from other biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) among Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in daily practice. We examined 24 consecutive RA patients who had not achieved low disease activity (LDA) as the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) despite previous bDMARD therapy in this cohort study. We attempted to determine predictive variables that are associated with achieving DAS28-ESR LDA at 22 weeks post-IFX introduction, by performing univariate analysis. The median DAS28-ESR at baseline was 5.41. Sixteen patients (66.7%) had been treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i), and the other eight patients (33.3%) received a non-TNF-i (abatacept or tocilizumab). Nine patients (37.5%) achieved LDA or remission at 22 weeks. Univariate analyses showed that the variable to predict LDA achievement at 22 weeks was tender joints (>8 counts) at baseline (adjusted odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63; p = .02). Nine adverse events were observed during the study period, and infection requiring hospitalization was observed in one patient. Switching to IFX is effective to achieve LDA or remission for RA patients refractory to bDMARDs.

Abstract 587. Title: Safety of switching between rituximab biosimilars in onco-hematology.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-16
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727667
Abstract: Comparable clinical efficacy and safety of the reference rituximab (MABTHERA) and its biosimilars has been established in randomized trials. However, safety concerns are often raised when switching from reference to biosimilar products and between different biosimilars. In this prospective observational study we aimed at evaluating the safety of switching between reference and biosimilar rituximab (TRUXIMA and RIXATHON) at Trento General Hospital (Italy). All patients (n = 83) with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, n = 72) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL, n = 11) who received rituximab between March 2018 and March 2019 were asked to take part in the study. In 2017 and 2018 two tenders were carried out and two different biosimilars became available in the hospital, these were used sequentially. Thus, patients with or without previous treatments with the originator rituximab either received a biosimilar or were switched between different biosimilars. The incidence of adverse events in these groups of patients is described. The study population received 465 rituximab infusions and all received biosimilars. Fifty patients (60%) experienced at least one switch between different biosimilars or between rituximab originator and biosimilar, whereas 33 (40%) received one of the two biosimilars and one patient received reference rituximab. Adverse events (n = 146) were reported in 71 patients (84.5%). Treatment-related grade 3-4 events were reported in 5 patients (5.9%), whereas grade 1 rituximab related infusion events were observed in 6 patients (7.1%). No safety signal emerged in association with the use of a specific biosimilar nor with the practice of switching. Adverse events were similar, in terms of seriousness and frequency, to those described in the literature, providing further support to the clinical safety of rituximab biosimilars.

Abstract 588. Title: Safety and effectiveness of biosimilar of Rituximab CT-P10 in the treatment of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: the MARBLe study (Mixed cryoglobulinemiA Rituximab BiosimiLar).
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524338
Abstract: Rituximab (RTX) represents a milestone in the treatment of mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (MCV). Despite usually well-tolerated, RTX may induce different types of adverse drug reactions, including exacerbation of vasculitis. Recently, RTX biosimilar CT-P10 has been approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but no data are available about effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 in the treatment of MCV. In this multicenter open-label study, we analyzed the safety of CT-P10 in patients with MCV treated in first-line or after a shift by RTX originator. Fifty-one consecutive MCV patients (females/males 35/16, median age 68 years, median disease duration 42 months, 51% HCV positive) were included in the study between July and December 2018 and were treated with CT-P10 (group 1). Safety and effectiveness of CT-P10 were compared with a retrospective group (group 2) including 75 consecutive patients treated with RTX originator between July 2017 and July 2018. Thirty-six patients were treated with CT-P10 for the first time, while the other 15 switched from RTX originator. RTX was administrated with high or dosage schemes (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> four times a week apart/1000 mg twice one week apart or 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice one week apart). During a month period after the last infusion, 13/51 adverse events (AE) were observed in group 1 and 17/75 in group 2 (p not significant). Among them, 7/13 and 6/17 (in group 1 and 2, respectively) could be considered immune-mediated AE (p not significant). At univariate analysis patients with IM-AE were more frequently males (p = 0.04) and with a lower disease duration (p = 0.03), but both the parameters were not significant at logistic regression. About clinical response after 6 months by the end of the treatment, no differences were observed between patients treated with originator and CT-P10 regarding the response to the therapy. No differences were observed in safety and effectiveness between patients naïve at RTX or switching from originator. Despite the higher prevalence of immune-mediated AE among patients treated with CT-P10 than originator, we have observed no significant differences between the 2 groups. The use of a low-dosage regimen is more common in group 1 than in group 2, representing a possible bias of the study, possibly influencing the appearance of AE. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of biosimilars, their use could be helpful to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator. Multicenter studies including a large number of patients and the new RTX biosimilars could be useful to fully elucidate the possible risk of immune-mediated adverse events with biosimilar drugs. Considering the cost/efficacy ratio of CT-P10, its use could help to treat a large number of MCV patients with an effectiveness and safety comparable to originator.

Abstract 589. Title: Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity is Not Affected by Switching From Infliximab Originator to a Biosimilar in Pediatric Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30633088
Abstract: Rising evidence demonstrates that there are no differences in efficacy and safety between infliximab (IFX) originator and IFX biosimilar CT-P13 in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, most data are derived from adult patients, and data on pharmacokinetics are limited. The authors evaluated long-term IFX trough levels, immunogenicity, and remission rates in children with IBD who switched from IFX originator to biosimilar CT-P13.
In this single-center study, all children with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis receiving maintenance IFX therapy were switched from originator to biosimilar CT-P13. Demographics, disease activity indices, and IFX drug levels were collected from 6 months before (baseline) till 6 months after switching to CT-P13. All data are presented as median (interquartile range).
A total of 42 children (26 Crohn disease and 16 ulcerative colitis), with a median duration on IFX originator of 13.5 (6.8-35.5) months before switching to CT-P13, were included. No significant changes in IFX trough levels occurred after switching. The median baseline IFX trough level was 5.7 mcg/mL (3.8-9.3) versus 6.5 mcg/mL (3.9-8.6) at month 6 after switching (P = 0.900). Antibodies to IFX appeared in one patient after switching. The proportion of patients in clinical and/or biological remission did not significantly change after switching (all P > 0.05). No significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, weight, and body mass index after the switch. Safety profile was also comparable.
Pediatric patients with IBD on IFX originator can be successfully switched during maintenance to biosimilar CT-P13 without affecting efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, or safety.

Abstract 590. Title: Perception of Originator Biologics and Biosimilars: A Survey Among Belgian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients and Rheumatologists.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28929342
Abstract: Among patients and rheumatologists, current knowledge and perception of biosimilars in comparison with originator biologics is unknown.
The aim of this study was to investigate this knowledge and perception in Belgian rheumatologists and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Anonymous web surveys were conducted in Belgian RA patients (n = 121) and rheumatologists (n = 41) during the period January-March 2016. The surveys covered topics on knowledge, similarity, price, preference, interchangeability, extrapolation and switching. Descriptive and statistical analyses of responses were performed.
Familiarity with biosimilars was reported by 49% of patients, of whom 77% knew what biosimilars were. RA patients equally questioned the proven efficacy of originators and biosimilars in RA, as well as their side effects and suitability. Furthermore, RA patients questioned the safety of biosimilars more often than that of originators (35 vs. 20%, respectively; p = 0.0094). Rheumatologists, more so than patients, expressed concerns that there might be differences between originators and biosimilars in terms of quality, safety, and price (p = 0.0292, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0129, respectively). The opinions of rheumatologists on interchangeability and extrapolation of indications varied. The price of an originator contributed substantially to the medicine preference of rheumatologists (p = 0.0002), but not patients.
Our study showed that rheumatologists, more so than patients, were convinced that there can be differences between originators and biosimilars. Despite safety being the major concern of patients, patients trusted their physician's decision to start on or switch to a biosimilar. The evolution of the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium might thus depend mainly on the perception of physicians.

Abstract 591. Title: Real-Life Efficacy, Immunogenicity and Safety of Biosimilar Infliximab.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28147369
Abstract: Recently, the use of biosimilar infliximab (IFX) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases has become widespread in some European and non-European countries. Data on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity from real-life cohorts are accumulating. The first reports showed similar outcomes in the induction and maintenance of remission, mucosal healing, safety and immunogenicity profile to the originator IFX. In the present review, we aimed to summarize the existing knowledge on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profile of biosimilar IFX reported from real-life cohorts.

Abstract 592. Title: Cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis in Greece.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976189
Abstract: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other treatment options currently available for the management of adult patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, who have had an inadequate response, loss of response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic agent, in Greece.
A Markov model was adapted for projecting lifetime costs and outcomes, for a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis from a Greek payer perspective. Patients entered the model in the active ulcerative colitis state and transitioned to a remission or response state or they underwent colectomy. Following an initial 8-week induction treatment period, patients received maintenance therapy until loss of response. Nonresponders could switch to up to two subsequent biologic lines. Clinical efficacy, adverse event rates and utilities derived from OCTAVE trials and a network-meta-analysis (NMA), while adverse event-related disutilities were obtained from the literature. Information on treatment pathways and resource use was provided by an advisory board due to a lack of local data. Unit costs derived from official national sources (€, 2018).
Over a life-time horizon, treating moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis with tofacitinib resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lower total costs compared to vedolizumab (0.018; €6408), infliximab (biosimilar) (0.009; €3031), golimumab (0.042; €1988) and infliximab (originator) (0.009; €6724). Hence, tofacitinib was estimated to be dominant over all comparators.
The results of the analysis suggest that in the Greek setting, tofacitinib could be considered a cost-effective (dominant) treatment option for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis.

Abstract 593. Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Switching from Innovator Infliximab to Biosimilar CT-P13 in Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases: A Real-World Case Study.
Publication Date: 2017-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28667384
Abstract: CT-P13 is a biosimilar with comparable pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety to its reference product (RP), infliximab. Studies have shown that switching from RP to CT-P13 does not reduce the effectiveness or safety of treatment.
In this retrospective real-world study, patients with inflammatory diseases treated with RP were switched to CT-P13 (n = 7) or continued on RP (n = 6). Clinical outcomes were compared between groups after four treatment cycles.
CT-P13 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to its RP. All patients who switched to the biosimilar maintained or improved their clinical response, including two who remained in remission and three who moved into remission. In the RP group, five patients maintained their clinical response, with one achieving remission. Safety profiles were similar between groups.
CT-P13 was equally effective as infliximab RP in this real-world study. CT-P13 is a valid, lower-cost alternative for patients currently receiving RP.

Abstract 594. Title: A non-interventional study of biosimilar granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in a community oncology centre.
Publication Date: 2012-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23118804
Abstract: Prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the severity of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Biosimilar G-CSF is now approved for use, based on comparable efficacy, safety and quality with the originator product.
We conducted a retrospective review of patients' charts following the switch from originator G-CSF (Neupogen(®)) to biosimilar G-CSF (Zarzio(®)/Filgrastim Hexal(®)) in a large community oncology practice. A total of 77 consecutive patients with cancer who received biosimilar G-CSF were reviewed, as were 25 patients who received originator G-CSF at the same centre.
The median age of patients in the biosimilar G-CSF cohort was 67 years (range 20-83). In this cohort 48% had chemotherapy with a febrile neutropenia risk of >20%. Biosimilar G-CSF was given as primary prophylaxis in 52% and as secondary prophylaxis in 48% of patients. Age and febrile neutropenia in medical history or in previous chemotherapy were factors that triggered the use of G-CSF in patients with a febrile neutropenia risk of <20%. One patient developed febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia led to chemotherapy dose reductions in five patients (6.5%) and discontinuation in two patients (2.5%). No unexpected safety findings were observed. Patient characteristics were generally similar in the originator G-CSF cohort. Only 24% of patients had a febrile neutropenia risk >20% and 36% received primary prophylactic G-CSF. One patient developed febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia led to chemotherapy dose reductions in two patients (8%) and discontinuation in two patients (8%).
Biosimilar G-CSF was effective and prevented dose reductions/discontinuation in the majority of patients. Biosimilar G-CSF was considered clinically comparable to its reference product.

Abstract 595. Title: Navigating uncharted waters: Developing a standardized approach for evaluating and implementing biosimilar products at a comprehensive cancer center.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-22
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289499
Abstract: The processes for formulary implementation and electronic health record (EHR) integration of biosimilar products at a comprehensive cancer center are described. Implications for research protocols are also discussed.
The existing literature focuses on practical considerations for formulary addition of biosimilar products, but there is a lack of guidance on how to implement the change, particularly within the EHR. Before building the ordering tools for biosimilars, the clinical and informatics teams should determine the role of biosimilars at the institution, identify drug-specific product characteristics that affect medication build, and characterize implications of future formulary changes or drug shortages. Leveraging an orderable record provides the ability to include logic that maps to multiple products and also allows for future implementation of changes within the medication record rather than requiring "swaps" at the treatment protocol level. The institutional review board should coordinate changes in affected research protocols and consent forms and work with principal investigators to amend protocols when necessary. Pharmacy leaders should develop processes to oversee inventory during the transition period and minimize the risk of errors.
The development of a standardized approach for evaluating and implementing biosimilar products improves efficiency and collaboration among the various team members responsible for the products' integration into existing workflows, including implications for clinical research. Implementing biosimilars for agents used to treat cancer will pose new challenges and require additional considerations. Partial implementation of biosimilars continues to pose multiple challenges in the provision of patient care.

Abstract 596. Title: Outcome in ulcerative colitis after switch from adalimumab/golimumab to infliximab: A multicenter retrospective study.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30472389
Abstract: Anti-TNF therapies infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), and golimumab (GOL) are approved for treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). In UC, only the switch from IFX to ADA has been investigated, reaching no more than 10-43% remission rates at 12 months.
Of the present study was to investigate disease outcome after a switch from subcutaneous (SC) agents to the intravenous (IV) agent (IFX).
In this retrospective multicentre study, we analysed the charts of UC patients unresponsive/intolerant or with secondary loss of response (LOR) to ADA or GOL who were switched to IFX. We evaluated clinical response and remission together with adverse events at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up.
Seventy-six patients were included; 38 patients started ADA and 38 started GOL for a mean therapy duration of 6 ± 6 months. Indications for switch were adverse events in 3%, primary failure in 79%, and LOR in 18% of patients. Clinical remission was reached by 47%, 50%, and 77% of patients, respectively. Patients that switched for LOR did numerically, but not statistically, better than patients who switched for primary failure.
Our data show a superior remission rate in SC to IV anti-TNF switch in UC compared to the IV to SC switch reported in literature.

Abstract 598. Title: Efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared with reference trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer (LILAC study): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880292
Abstract: ABP 980 (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) is a biosimilar of trastuzumab, with analytical, functional, and pharmacokinetic similarities. We compared the clinical safety and efficacy of ABP 980 with that of trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer.
We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled equivalence trial at 97 study centres in 20 countries, mainly in Europe and South America. Eligible women were aged 18 years or older, had histologically confirmed HER2-positive invasive early breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, and were planning to have surgical resection of the breast tumour with sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After four cycles of run-in anthracycline-based chemotherapy, patients were assigned 1:1 to receive ABP 980 or trastuzumab with a permuted block design (blocks of four) computer-generated randomisation schedule. Patients received neoadjuvant therapy with a loading dose (8 mg/kg) of ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in a 90 min intravenous infusion, followed by three cycles of 6 mg/kg intravenous ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks in 30 min intravenous infusions (or 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> paclitaxel once per week for 12 cycles if that was the local standard of care). Randomisation was stratified by T stage, node status, hormone receptor status, planned paclitaxel dosing schedule, and geographical region. Surgery was completed 3-7 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, after which adjuvant treatment with ABP 980 or trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 1 year after the first dose in the study. Patients had been randomly assigned at baseline to continue APB 980, continue trastuzumab, or switch from trastuzumab to APB 980 as their adjuvant treatment. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were risk difference and risk ratio (RR) of pathological complete response in breast tissue and axillary lymph nodes assessed at a local laboratory in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of neoadjuvant investigational product and underwent surgery. We assessed safety in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of investigational product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01901146 and Eudra, number CT 2012-004319-29.
Of 827 patients enrolled, 725 were randomly assigned to receive ABP 980 (n=364) or trastuzumab (n=361). The primary endpoint was assessable in 696 patients (358 who received ABP 980 and 338 who received trastuzumab). Pathological complete response was recorded in 172 (48%, 95% CI 43-53) of 358 patients in the ABP 980 group and 137 (41%, 35-46) of 338 in the trastuzumab group (risk difference 7·3%, 90% CI 1·2-13·4; RR 1·188, 90% CI 1·033-1·366), with the upper bounds of the CIs exceeding the predefined equivalence margins of 13% and 1·318, respectively. Pathological complete response in the central laboratory assessment was seen in 162 (48%) of 339 patients assigned to ABP 980 at baseline and 138 (42%) of 330 assigned to trastuzumab at baseline (risk difference 5·8%, 90% CI -0·5 to 12·0, and RR 1·142, 90% CI 0·993 to 1·312). Grade 3 or worse adverse events during the neoadjuvant phase occurred in 54 (15%) of 364 patients in the ABP 980 group and 51 (14%) of 361 patients in the trastuzumab group, of which the most frequent grade 3 or worse event of interest was neutropenia, occurring in 21 (6%) patients in both groups. In the adjuvant phase, grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 349 patients continuing ABP 980, 11 (6%) of 171 continuing trastuzumab, and 13 (8%) of 171 who switched from trastuzumab to ABP 980, the most frequent grade 3 or worse events of interest were infections and infestations (four [1%], two [1%], and two [1%]), neutropenia (three [1%], two [1%], and one [1%]), and infusion reactions (two [1%], two [1%], and three [2%]). Two patients died from adverse events judged to be unrelated to the investigational products: one died from pneumonia while receiving neoadjuvant ABP 980 and one died from septic shock while receiving adjuvant ABP 980 after trastuzumab.
Although the lower bounds of the 90% CIs for RR and risk difference showed non-inferiority, the upper bounds exceeded the predefined equivalence margins when based on local laboratory review of tumour samples, meaning that non-superiority was non-conclusive. In our sensitivity analyses based on central laboratory evaluation of tumour samples, estimates for the two drugs were contained within the predefined equivalence margins, indicating similar efficacy. ABP 980 and trastuzumab had similar safety outcomes in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the study.

Abstract 599. Title: Risk management of biosimilars in oncology: each medicine is a work in progress.
Publication Date: 2012-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22274817
Abstract: Drug licensing and drug safety monitoring for standard chemical entities have been established and are routinely used. These have resulted in a solid foundation of knowledge from which confident therapeutic decisions can be made. For many chemical entities, this advanced level of experience is also present for the generic products. The expertise surrounding the development of biosimilar competitor versions is increasing and progress is encouraging. To address the re-engineering and comparability complexities of biosimilars, the European Union imposed a requirement that risk management plans be included in the medications' marketing applications. This paper summarizes and discusses the circumstances complicating the public's view of drug safety, historical incidents during the transition from innovative to competitor products, as well as retrospective assessments of the development and post-marketing experiences thus far with two biosimilars. Through assessing the market entries and post-marketing experiences of biosimilars used in oncology, the healthcare field can better prepare for the next wave of comparator-products: biosimilar monoclonal antibodies.

Abstract 600. Title: Increasing Operational Capacity and Reducing Costs of Rituximab Administration: A Costing Analysis.
Publication Date: 2020-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32314553
Abstract: Originator intravenous rituximab is an important rheumatology treatment but is costly, and administration requires several hours. Because biosimilar rituximab may cost less and subcutaneous rituximab requires a shorter visit, both may reduce costs and increase treatment capacity (infusions per year).
We implemented time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), a method to assess costs and opportunities to increase capacity, throughout the care pathway for 26 patients receiving a total of 30 rituximab infusions. Using the TDABC estimates, we created a base case, which included provider time, salaries, infusion rates and times, and drug formulation, to simulate an induction cycle (two infusions). We varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses and assessed the impact of infusion rates and formulation (biosimilar vs. subcutaneous) on capacity before and after assuming a fixed budget.
The base-case cost was $19 452; more than 90% was due to drug cost. In sensitivity analyses, varying projected biosimilar cost led to the greatest cost savings ($8,988 per cycle). Faster infusion rates and subcutaneous rituximab increased annual capacity (300% and 800%, respectively). With a fixed budget, subcutaneous rituximab led to a relative increase in capacity over biosimilar rituximab except when biosimilar cost savings relative to originator rituximab exceeded 40%; faster biosimilar infusion rates did not meaningfully affect these findings.
Using TDABC, we demonstrate that rituximab cost is the primary driver of treatment cost, but capacity is largely driven by treatment time. Subcutaneous rituximab leads to higher capacity than biosimilar rituximab across a range of plausible costs; its use in rheumatology should be studied.

Abstract 601. Title: Assessing physician and patient acceptance of infliximab biosimilars in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis across Germany.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28331299
Abstract: We examined rheumatologists' motivation for prescribing biosimilars, assessed their treatment preferences in relation to prescribing behavior and explored patient attitudes to biosimilars.
Data were taken from the Adelphi Real World Biosimilars Programme, a real-world, cross-sectional study undertaken with German rheumatologists and patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis in 2015-2016. Rheumatologists provided data on their prescribing behavior and attitudes toward biosimilars and invited the next eight eligible consecutive consulting patients to complete a questionnaire. Rheumatologists were split into "investigative", "conservative" and "other" groups.
Overall, 50 rheumatologists and 261 patients participated. Biosimilars accounted for <10% of all biologic therapy prescriptions, and >95% of rheumatologists would prescribe a biooriginator rather than biosimilar as the first- or second-line therapy if unrestricted. Patients showed some reluctance to accept biosimilars, and a small proportion of patients were unhappy when switched from a biooriginator to a biosimilar. Satisfaction with treatment was highest in patients who started treatment with a biooriginator prior to biosimilar availability. Patient concerns when starting treatment with a biooriginator or a biosimilar included not knowing enough about the drug (25%-41%), potential side effects (26%-32%) and potential long-term problems (19%-30%).
Study results demonstrate that there is some reluctance from patients to accept biosimilars and the need to educate patients who are unsure to allow them to be involved in decision making, highlighting the importance of patient and physician communication. There remains a need for further research into nonclinical switching and the long-term impact of prescribing biosimilars.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439289
Abstract: The 24-week equivalent efficacy and comparable safety results of the biosimilar SB5 and reference adalimumab (ADA) from the phase III randomized study in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been reported previously. We undertook this transition study to evaluate patients who switched from ADA to SB5 or who continued to receive SB5 or ADA up to 52 weeks.
In this phase III study, patients were initially randomized 1:1 to receive SB5 or ADA (40 mg subcutaneously every other week). At 24 weeks, patients receiving ADA were rerandomized 1:1 to continue with ADA (ADA/ADA group) or to switch to SB5 (ADA/SB5 group) up to week 52; patients receiving SB5 continued with SB5 for 52 weeks (SB5 group). Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were evaluated up to 52 weeks.
The full analysis set population consisted of 542 patients (269 in the SB5 group, 273 in the ADA overall group [patients who were randomized to receive ADA at week 0], 125 in the ADA/SB5 group, and 129 in the ADA/ADA group). The percentages of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response) at week 24 were maintained after the transition from ADA to SB5, and these response rates were comparable across treatment groups throughout the study. ACR20 response rates ranged from 73.4% to 78.8% at week 52. Radiographic progression was minimal and comparable across treatment groups. The safety profile and the incidence of antidrug antibodies were comparable across treatment groups after transition.
SB5 was well tolerated over 1 year in patients with RA, with efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity comparable to those of ADA. Switching from ADA to SB5 had no treatment-emergent issues such as increased adverse events, increased immunogenicity, or loss of efficacy.

Abstract 603. Title: [Opportunities and challenges of extrapolation for biosimilars].
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27711947
Abstract: Although biosimilars approved in the European Union have proved to be safe and efficacious, their licensing requirements continue to be disputed by medical professionals. In particular, extrapolation to indications of the originator without one's own clinical data of the biosimilar is controversial. Conceptually, the development of biosimilars is derived from that of generics. However, due to their complexity and inherent variability, considerably more data are necessary for biosimilars to demonstrate comparability with the originator (the reference product) than for the usually low-molecular generics. Biosimilars increase competition and help contain healthcare, and they improve access for patients to valuable treatments with biologicals. However, biosimilar development is a laborious and lengthy process and requires major biotechnological know-how. The basis is comprehensive, structural, and functional characterization of the biosimilar and reference product as well as their comparison with suitable and sensitive methods. The clinical development programme is reduced and tailored to address remaining uncertainties and to confirm comparable clinical performance. Extrapolation of data to other indications of the reference product is the greatest cost advantage of biosimilar development, but must always be scientifically justified and, if necessary, substantiated by further data. The scientific principles underlying the comparability exercise for a biosimilar are the same as those applied to a change in the manufacturing process of an already licensed biological. In both cases, different versions of a biological substance are compared and the clinical relevance of observed differences is assessed. Competent authorities do have decades of experience in evaluating changes in the manufacturing process, which they can now apply to biosimilars. For approval of a biosimilar and extrapolation of data, the totality of the evidence from the complete comparability exercise is considered, as has been the case for the first biosimilar infliximab.

Abstract 604. Title: Nano differential scanning fluorimetry for comparability studies of therapeutic proteins.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31935356
Abstract: Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been extensively used in the biopharmaceutical industry to characterize protein thermal stability and domain folding integrity. Recently, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) has emerged as a powerful tool for thermal stability analysis and studies of protein domain unfolding. Due to increased interests in the qualification of characterization methods, we are in this study presenting the qualification results for the comparability studies of thermal stability analysis using nanoDSF. The results show that nanoDSF is able to detect thermal transition signals for mAbs, BiTE® molecules, and cytokines at a wide concentration range with high precision, clearly indicating that nanoDSF is suitable for characterization including comparability studies of therapeutic proteins. Compared to the current recognized industry standard DSC, the nanoDSF method enables thermal stability analysis over a much wider concentration range, consumes considerably less materials, and provides significantly higher throughput.

Abstract 605. Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneous versus intravenous CT-P13 in rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized phase I/III trial.
Publication Date: 2021-May-14
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230526
Abstract: To assess non-inferiority of s.c. to i.v. CT-P13 in RA.
Patients with active RA and inadequate response to MTX participated in this phase I/III double-blind study at 76 sites. Patients received CT-P13 i.v. 3 mg/kg [week (W) 0 and W2] before randomization (1:1) at W6 to CT-P13 s.c. via pre-filled syringe (PFS) 120 mg biweekly until W28, or CT-P13 i.v. 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks until W22. Randomization was stratified by country, W2 serum CRP and W6 body weight. From W30, all patients received CT-P13 s.c. In a usability sub-study, patients received CT-P13 s.c. via auto-injector (W46-54) then PFS (W56-64). The primary endpoint was change (decrease) from baseline in disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-CRP at W22 (non-inferiority margin: -0.6).
Of 357 patients enrolled, 343 were randomized to CT-P13 s.c. (n = 167) or CT-P13 i.v. (n = 176) at W6. The least-squares mean change (decrease) from baseline (standard error) in DAS28-CRP at W22 was 2.21 (0.22) for CT-P13 s.c. (n = 162) and 1.94 (0.21) for CT-P13 i.v. [n = 168; difference 0.27 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.52)], establishing non-inferiority. Efficacy findings were similar between arms at W54. Safety was similar between arms throughout: 92 (54.8%; CT-P13 s.c.) and 117 (66.9%; CT-P13 i.v.) patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (from W6). There were no treatment-related deaths or new safety findings. Usability was similar for CT-P13 s.c. via auto-injector or PFS.
CT-P13 s.c. was non-inferior to CT-P13 i.v. in active RA. The convenience of s.c. administration could benefit patients.

Abstract 606. Title: Biosimilar and Follow-on Insulin: The Ins, Outs, and Interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861004
Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To provide an overview of the differences between biosimilars and generics, and to summarize regulatory requirements and outstanding issues related to biosimilar insulins in the United States, including the issue of interchangeability. <b>Data Sources:</b> References were obtained using MEDLINE searches, the bibliographies of articles identified during the searches, review articles, and general Internet searches. Key words included the following: diabetes, insulin, biosimilar, regulatory, follow-on, and interchangeability. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> Articles, studies, regulatory documents, and opinion pieces that addressed issues around biosimilar/follow-on insulins and interchangeability of insulins in people with diabetes were selected for inclusion in this narrative review. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> There is understandable interest in the potential for new <i>copies</i> of existing insulins-termed biosimilar insulins or follow-on insulins-to reduce the substantial and growing costs associated with managing the diabetes epidemic and to improve access, as has been achieved with conventional generic drugs. However, biosimilars or follow-on insulins are not generics. There are critical differences between biologic products and conventional chemical drugs, which present specific challenges to manufacturers, regulators, and clinicians. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health care providers and payers need to be aware of the issues surrounding biosimilar and follow-on insulins as they become more widely available in the coming years. In particular, in the face of limited data on comparative safety and efficacy, careful consideration needs to be given when interchanging between originator and biosimilar drugs, when switching patients from one biosimilar drug to the other.

Abstract 607. Title: Biosimilar switching - current state of knowledge.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30237628
Abstract: Evidence from over 10 years of clinical experience demonstrates that biosimilar medicines approved in the European Union can be used for all their registered indications as safely as their originators and with no negative impact on therapeutic efficacy. The debate on the use of biosimilars in rheumatology focuses specifically on the safety of switching between biosimilars and reference products. Studies conducted to date, including randomised double-blind and open-label extension trials, have not demonstrated any significant differences in therapeutic efficacy or safety between patients switched from one medicine to another and those who were continued on a single medicine. According to the latest recommendations for the use of biosimilars in rheumatic diseases, developed by an international task force in 2017, there is no clinical evidence that a single switch from an originator to a biosimilar medicine is associated with any significant risk for patient safety or reduction in therapeutic efficacy.

Abstract 608. Title: Switching to Biosimilar SDZ-ADL in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: 48-Week Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity Results From the Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind ADMYRA Study.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33119861
Abstract: Sandoz adalimumab SDZ-ADL (GP-2017) is an approved adalimumab biosimilar with similar efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity to reference adalimumab (ref-ADL) as confirmed by analytical, pharmacokinetic and confirmatory studies. ADMYRA, a phase III double-blind study, was conducted with an aim to generate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity comparability data in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) having inadequate response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX). The study also evaluated an aspect of 'switching' reference product to the biosimilar in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity up to Week 48.
Eligible patients (N = 353) were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous (sc) SDZ-ADL 40 mg (n = 177) or ref-ADL (n = 176) every other week from Week 0 to Week 24. At Week 24, all patients with at least a moderate response by Disease Activity Score-28 including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) in the SDZ-ADL group continued SDZ-ADL (n = 159), and in the ref-ADL group were switched to SDZ-ADL (n = 166), treated for up to 46 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in DAS28-CRP from baseline at Week 12. Other efficacy endpoints included proportion of patients with European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, EULAR remission, Boolean remission, safety and immunogenicity.
The DAS28-CRP score changes from baseline at Week 12 were similar between SDZ-ADL (- 2.16) and ref-ADL (- 2.18) with a mean difference (95% CI) of 0.02 (- 0.24 to 0.27), which was within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ± 0.6. After switching treatment from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL, the mean DAS28-CRP change was similar between the SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' group (- 3.09 vs - 3.05). The proportion of patients with good/moderate EULAR response was 69.2%/29.0% in the SDZ-ADL group and 68.0%/29.6% in the 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' group. The proportion of patients in EULAR remission was 51.4% and 54.4% and in Boolean remission was 16.8% and 21.6% for SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups, respectively. The secondary endpoints were similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and injection-site reactions were low and similar between SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups (AEs 70.6% vs 68.8%, injection-site reactions 4.0% vs 6.3%), and most of these patients experienced AEs of mild or moderate severity. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 24.2% and 25.6% of patients treated with SDZ-ADL and 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL', respectively, from baseline to Week 48, of which 72.5% in SDZ-ADL and 79.1% in 'ref-ADL/switched SDZ-ADL' groups were neutralizing.
In patients with moderate-to-severe RA who had an inadequate response to DMARDs, SDZ-ADL demonstrated a similar efficacy and a comparable safety and immunogenicity profile to ref-ADL. Efficacy was sustained after switching from ref-ADL to SDZ-ADL with no impact on safety (NCT02744755).

Abstract 609. Title: Patient Perspectives on Biosimilar Insulin.
Publication Date: 2014-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876533
Abstract: Given that a new wave of biosimilar insulins will likely enter the market in coming years, it is important to understand patient perspectives on these biosimilars. A survey (N = 3214) conducted by the market research company dQ&A, which maintains a 10 000-patient panel of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in roughly equal measure, investigated these perspectives. The survey asked whether patients would switch to a hypothetical less expensive biosimilar insulin that was approved by their provider. Approximately 66% of respondents reported that they would "definitely" or "likely" use a biosimilar insulin, while 17% reported that they were "unlikely" to use or would "definitely not use" such a product. Type 2 diabetes patients demonstrated slightly more willingness to use biosimilars than type 1 diabetes patients. Common patient concerns included whether biosimilars would be as effective as reference products (~650 respondents), whether side effect profiles would deviate from those of reference products (~220 respondents), and the design of the delivery device (~50 respondents). While cost savings associated with biosimilar insulins could increase patient uptake, especially among patients without health insurance (some recent estimates suggest that biosimilars will come at a substantial discount), patients may still need assurance that a cheaper price tag is not necessarily associated with substandard quality. Overall, the dQ&A survey indicates that the majority of patients are willing to consider biosimilar insulins, but manufacturers will need to work proactively to address and assuage patient concerns regarding efficacy, safety, drug administration, and other factors.

Abstract 610. Title: Biosimilars-Emerging Role in Nephrology.
Publication Date: 2019-Sep-06
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082337
Abstract: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a "biosimilar" agent as a biologic that is highly similar to the reference or originator biologic product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the safety, purity, and potency. The advantage of biosimilars is that they are usually about 15%-30% less expensive than the reference product, which results in system-wide cost savings and increased patient access. Because biologic drugs are produced by living organisms, they are by nature heterogeneous and identical copies cannot be made, unlike generic versions of small-molecule drugs. Proposed biosimilars must undergo a rigorous evaluation process to demonstrate a high degree of structural and functional similarity with the reference biologic. Once that is confirmed, a stepwise process of comparison with the reference agent with regard to animal trials, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and human efficacy/safety is conducted. The experience with biosimilars in other highly regulated markets where patent protection for originator biologics is not as robust as in the United States has been favorable in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost savings. An FDA approval pathway was created in 2009 to expedite the approval of biosimilars; as of early 2018 nine agents had been approved through that pathway, none in nephrology. The first United States biosimilar epoetin was approved on May 15, 2018, but does not have an interchangeability designation, meaning that prescribers must specifically write for the biosimilar product for patients to receive it. Given the unfamiliarity of biosimilars within the nephrology community it is recommended that educational programs be developed to address this unmet need and for research to be conducted addressing the perceptual, clinical, and economic effect of biosimilars on our patients.

Abstract 611. Title: Introduction of Biosimilar Therapeutics Into Nephrology Practice in the United States: Report of a Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.
Publication Date: 2016-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27599628
Abstract: Biosimilars are biologic medicines highly similar to the reference product with no meaningful clinical differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency. All biologic medicines are produced by living cells, resulting in an inherent heterogeneity in their higher order structures and post-translational modifications. In 2010, the US Congress enacted legislation to streamline the approval process for biosimilars of products losing patent protection, with the goal of decreasing costs and improving patient access to therapeutically important but expensive biologic agents. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first biosimilar agent through this pathway. Approval of additional biosimilar agents in the United States, including those used by nephrologists, is anticipated. Given the relative lack of knowledge regarding biosimilars and their approval process and a lack of trust by the nephrology community regarding their safety and efficacy, the National Kidney Foundation conducted a symposium, Introduction of Biosimilar Therapeutics Into Nephrology Practice in the U.S., September 17 to 18, 2015. Issues related to manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, interchangeability, substitution/switching, nomenclature, and clinician and patient awareness and acceptance were examined. This report summarizes the main discussions at the symposium, highlights several controversies, and makes recommendations related to public policy, professional and patient education, and research needs.

Abstract 612. Title: [Biosimilars in the European Union: current situation and challenges].
Publication Date: 2020-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33034693
Abstract: Biosimilars are medicinal products that are highly similar to approved biopharmaceuticals. Biosimilars enable patient access to biological therapies that would otherwise be restricted or delayed due to cost reasons. After the successful introduction of low-molecular biosimilars in 2006, highly complex monoclonal antibodies have also been available since 2013 as biosimilars for treating autoimmune diseases and oncologic indications. In principle, the biosimilar concept can be applied to all well-characterized biologicals; in the future, blood clotting factors or drugs containing nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA gene therapy or mRNA vaccines, will also be an option for biosimilar development.In some instances, biosimilarity can be demonstrated by physicochemical and functional similarity, and additional comparative clinical efficacy and safety studies have been considered no longer necessary for several product categories in recent years. Switching a patient from a reference drug to a biosimilar or from one biosimilar to another (interchangeability) has so far been considered harmless. Since February 2020, there has been a provisional decision in Germany that patients should be switched according to an economic prescription method. Further scientific findings on the interchangeability of biosimilars and experiences with the supply practices of biosimilars should be collected and evaluated.In this article, the current situation regarding marketing authorizations of biosimilars in the European Union is reviewed. The role of clinical trials for biosimilars is presented, and challenges of biosimilar development and views on interchangeability are discussed.

Abstract 613. Title: Position of Scientific Oncological Societies Towards Biosimilar Antibodies.
Publication Date: 2019-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019436
Abstract: First biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies have recently been approved in oncology. Biosimilars enable economic competition, alleviate the financial burden for insurances, and may facilitate access to these drugs in low-income countries. Biosimilars are not completely identical to the original drug. The approval of biosimilars is only partially based on results of randomized clinical studies. In the introduction phase of new biosimilars, this can lead to uncertainties for patients and physicians. Based on the current clinical data and experiences, biosimilars of monoclonal antibodies in oncology show no significant differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in comparison to the patented originals. Scientific medical societies recommend the use of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and support switching in long-term treatments. However, the use of biosimilars for off-label indications requires additional attention towards efficacy and safety. Active counselling of the patient by the treating physician is the most important step in the informed consent process, especially when switching from an original to a biosimilar. Careful documentation of the prescribed drug and enhanced pharmacovigilance are recommended for the use of biosimilars.

Abstract 614. Title: A descriptive analysis of real-world treatment patterns of innovator (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) and biosimilar infliximab in an infliximab-naïve Turkish population.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30323555
Abstract: Biosimilar IFX (CT-P13) received marketing approval in Turkey for treatment of rheumatologic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis. Population data on real-world treatment patterns of CT-P13 following marketing approval in European countries are largely unreported. This study examined the prescribing and medication utilization patterns of innovator infliximab (IFX) and CT-P13 in Turkey for patients with RA or IBD naïve to either IFX.
Adult patients with ≥1 diagnosis claim for RA or IBD and ≥1 claim for IFX or CT-P13 were identified in the Turkish Ministry of Health database during the following identification periods: 1 Oct 2014-30 May 2015 (RA) and 1 Oct 2014-31 Dec 2015 (IBD). Continuous medical and pharmacy coverage for ≥12 months before and after the date of the first dose (index) IFX or CT-P13 was also required. Separate analyses were done for each population.
Seven hundred and seventy nine adult RA and 581 IBD patients met the selection criteria. The majority of RA (74%; n=575) and IBD patients (87%; n=504) were initiated on IFX. The average study observation period was 16 months for the RA and 12 months for the IBD population. Over the observation periods, discontinuation among RA patients occurred in 42% of IFX and 63% of CT-P13 while discontinuation in the IBD cohort occurred in 38% of IFX; and 62% of CT-P13.
In this population-based study, more IFX-naïve RA and IBD patients were initially treated with IFX than CT-P13. Discontinuation and switching were observed more often and earlier among patients treated with CT-P13 regardless of disease state. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for these observed differences.

Abstract 615. Title: Efficacy and safety of biosimilar CT-P13 compared with originator infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease: an international, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-27
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30929895
Abstract: The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 was approved for use in Crohn's disease after clinical comparison with originator infliximab in ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis; however, concerns about such indication extrapolation have been expressed. This study investigated whether CT-P13 is non-inferior to infliximab in patients with Crohn's disease who were naive to biological therapy.
In this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study, we enrolled patients with active Crohn's disease who had not responded to, or were intolerant to, non-biological treatments. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive CT-P13 then CT-P13, CT-P13 then infliximab, infliximab then infliximab, or infliximab then CT-P13, with switching occurring at week 30. Patients received 5 mg/kg CT-P13 or infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks up to week 54. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a decrease of 70 points or more in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) from baseline to week 6. A non-inferiority margin of -20% was set (CT-P13 was non-inferior to infliximab if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was greater than -20). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02096861, and is completed.
Between Aug 20, 2014, and Feb 15, 2017, 308 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 220 patients were enrolled: 111 were randomly assigned to initiate CT-P13 (56 to the CT-P13-CT-P13 group and 55 to the CT-P13-infliximab group) and 109 to initiate infliximab (54 to the infliximab-infliximab group and 55 to the infliximab-CT-P13 group). CDAI-70 response rates at week 6 were similar for CT-P13 (77 [69·4%, 95% CI 59·9 to 77·8] of 111) and infliximab (81 [74·3%, 95% CI 65·1 to 82·2] of 109; difference -4·9% [95% CI -16·9 to 7·3]), thereby establishing non-inferiority. Over the total study period, 147 (67%) patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (36 [64%] in the CT-P13-CT-P13 group, 34 [62%] in the CT-P13-infliximab group, 37 [69%] in the infliximab-infliximab group, and 40 [73%] in the infliximab-CT-P13 group).
This study showed non-inferiority of CT-P13 to infliximab in patients with active Crohn's disease. Biosimilar CT-P13 could be a new option for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.

Abstract 616. Title: The rise of biosimilars: potential benefits and drawbacks in rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2014-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24961712
Abstract: Although biologic agents are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the high price of drugs and restricted health care budgets have restricted easy access to biologics. Eventually, the use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be inversely associated with disease activity in countries with low gross domestic product. The EMA approved an infliximab biosimilar for the first time in September 2013. The first approval of a biosimilar monoclonal antibody by a major regulatory authority provided a global standard for subsequent biosimilars and for biopharmaceutical companies developing biosimilars. Biosimilars with a highly similar quality and efficacy profile at an acceptable lower cost would significantly increase affordability of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we will review the current status of first biosimilar antibody agent and the potential discussion points raised against biosimilars. In addition, the importance of awareness on biosimilars for stakeholders is discussed.

Abstract 617. Title: CT-P13 in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2017-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28571501
Abstract: The first biosimilar infliximab, CT-P13 infliximab-dyyb was approved in 2013 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in 2016 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for 4 years. Areas covered: CT-P13 with the three brand names on the market has highly similar efficacy and safety profiles but lower price than originator infliximab and are approved in more than 80 countries. One of the most important determinants of the implementation of CT-P13 in the treatment of RA is scientific evidence from clinical studies and real-world pharmacovigilance data. Here, we review all available clinical data supporting the similarity of CT-P13 to originator infliximab in its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of RA and related arthritis. In addition, we consider the role of CT-P13 in therapeutic strategies for RA treatment. Expert commentary: With its highly similar efficacy and safety profile to originator infliximab and its lower price, CT-P13 is expected to be very useful in RA treatment, whether it is applied earlier or switched from originator infliximab or other biologics. Future educational initiatives will be important to overcome misunderstandings about biosimilars and to improve the implementation of CT-P13.

Abstract 618. Title: Comparative effectiveness of the biosimilar CT-P13.
Publication Date: 2017-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29172717
Abstract: The first biosimilar infliximab, CT-P13 (infliximab-dyyb) has been used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases for 4 years. CT-P13 has highly similar efficacy and safety profiles with a lower price than the originator infliximab and has been approved in 81 countries. Despite approval for clinical use, some knowledge gaps still limit the widespread and pertinent use of biosimilar CT-P13. One of the most important factors for proper utilization of CT-P13 for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is confidence in CT-P13, which could be enhanced by scientific evidence supporting the biosimilarity of CT-P13. Overall, five randomized controlled studies have been performed. For the other extrapolated indications, many observational induction and switching studies also support the utility of CT-P13 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Here, we review profiles of CT-P13 including physicochemical properties, clinical efficacy and safety data in all indications and current status.

Abstract 619. Title: Switching to biosimilars in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
Publication Date: 2018-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29914272
Abstract: For successful switching of bio-originators to biosimilars, confidence in the switch is an important criterion. To promote confidence, scientific evidence is critical, but still there are insufficient data for the majority of approved biosimilars. Areas covered: Scientific evidence for switching from bio-originator DMARDs to biosimilars is derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for switching, extension studies of RCTs for the approval process, and real-world observational studies. To identify candidate studies, PubMed was searched to collect appropriate studies in all approved biosimilars for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In addition, abstracts for scientific meetings were reviewed to discover abstracts focused on switching. To date, we have identified 17 extension studies of RCTs, 1 RCT, and 17 real-world observational studies. Most real-world studies have originated from CT-P13 and SB4. Switching was definitively safe and effective in most of studies, but some nocebo effects were observed. Expert commentary: Clear guidelines for switching and data from post-marketing surveillance and registries will be required to confirm existing results on the safety and efficacy of switching from bio-originators to biosimilars. To lessen the nocebo effect against biosimilars, effective educational programs should be provided for all stakeholders, including patients and physicians.

Abstract 621. Title: Efficacy and safety of CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: comparison between switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13 and continuing CT-P13 in the PLANETRA extension study.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27130908
Abstract: To assess the efficacy and safety of switching from the infliximab reference product (RP; Remicade) to its biosimilar CT-P13 (Remsima, Inflectra) or continuing CT-P13 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for an additional six infusions.
This open-label extension study recruited patients with RA who had completed the 54-week, randomised, parallel-group study comparing CT-P13 with RP (PLANETRA; NCT01217086). CT-P13 (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 8 weeks from weeks 62 to 102. All patients received concomitant methotrexate. Endpoints included American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response, ACR50, ACR70, immunogenicity and safety. Data were analysed for patients who received CT-P13 for 102 weeks (maintenance group) and for those who received RP for 54 weeks and then switched to CT-P13 (switch group).
Overall, 302 of 455 patients who completed the PLANETRA study enrolled into the extension. Of these, 158 had received CT-P13 (maintenance group) and 144 RP (switch group). Response rates at week 102 for maintenance versus switch groups, respectively, were 71.7% vs 71.8% for ACR20, 48.0% vs 51.4% for ACR50 and 24.3% vs 26.1% for ACR70. The proportion of patients with antidrug antibodies was comparable between groups (week 102: 40.3% vs 44.8%, respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in similar proportions of patients in the two groups during the extension study (53.5% and 53.8%, respectively).
Comparable efficacy and tolerability were observed in patients who switched from RP to its biosimilar CT-P13 for an additional year and in those who had long-term CT-P13 treatment for 2 years.

Abstract 622. Title: Using pharmacokinetics for tailoring prophylaxis in people with hemophilia switching between clotting factor products: A scoping review.
Publication Date: 2019-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31294337
Abstract: The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the current use of pharmacokinetics for tailoring prophylaxis in hemophilia patients switching between clotting factor products. Patients with hemophilia may require switching of clotting factor concentrates due to a variety of factors, but there have been perceived risks associated with switching, such as inhibitor development or suboptimal protection due to inadequate dosing while titrating treatment. Studies that look at patients switching from one clotting factor concentrate to another are categorized in terms of their primary and/or secondary objectives, notably biosimilarity and comparative pharmacokinetic studies and inhibitor development studies. Research on how best to switch concentrates with respect to dosing regimen are lacking, and currently a trial-and-error approach is used for dosing the new factor concentrate. In the future, studies looking at the predictability of pharmacokinetics (PK) of a new factor concentrate based on individual PK knowledge of the original factor concentrate may offer clinical benefit by providing a safer switching approach and protocol.

Abstract 623. Title: Nursing Roles: Clinical Implications Regarding Trends, Administration, and Education for Biosimilars in Oncology Practice.
Publication Date: 2018-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239530
Abstract: With the advent of biosimilars into the U.S. healthcare market, knowledge deficits exist for nurses and patients regarding the regulatory approval process and key nursing considerations for each of these new medications.
This article provides essential clinical information for oncology nurses who are directly involved in patient care who will be administering U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biosimilars for oncologic use. Oncology nurses must be informed on their therapeutic uses, mechanisms of action, and administration considerations.
An overview of biosimilars in the United States is given, and each FDA-approved oncology biosimilar medication is described in detail.
Oncology biosimilars are safe and effective treatment options that may increase patient access, decrease healthcare costs through competition, and improve the lives of patients with certain malignancies. Nurses are in key roles in patient care to foster the transition from previously patented, branded, and expensive medications to biosimilars that can achieve the same desired effects for a lower cost.

Abstract 624. Title: Brand-name drug, generic drug, orphan drug. Pharmacological therapy with biosimilar drugs - provision of due diligence in the treatment process.
Publication Date: 2013-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24592133
Abstract: Due diligence in the process of provision of healthcare services refers, among other elements, to the application of pharmacological therapy at a time which offers the greatest chance for a successful outcome of treatment, i.e. for achieving the optimum expected effect understood as an improvement in the patient's health, reduction of health risks or elimination of the disease. However, due diligence may also refer to actions aimed at ensuring that neither the patient nor the healthcare payer is required to incur unreasonable costs in the process of treatment. The validity of that statement stems not only from normative acts but also from ethical standards laid down in the Medical Code of Ethics (Article 57 section 2). It often happens that the provision of optimal treatment calls for deviations from the formal provisions included in Summary Product Characteristics (SPCs), and the application of drugs that are bioequivalent to reference drugs, which translates into a significant reduction of costs. The present study addresses the problem of acceptability of a specific form of drug substitution consisting in the replacement of a reference drug with a generic drug. Also explored are legal aspects associated with the possibility of therapy based on "off-label use". The study reviews normative acts existing in the Polish and EU legislation. It also provides a clear definition of orphan drug, which has made it possible to make a distinction and investigate mutual relations between the concepts of brand-name (reference) drug, orphan drug and generic drug.

Abstract 625. Title: Monitoring antigen-specific biologics: current knowledge and future prospects.
Publication Date: 2013-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23942545
Abstract: An increasing number of antigen-specific biologics have been introduced into clinical practice, and the ones that arrived first have already reached the end of their patented life span. Despite the use of these agents for over a decade, individualized dosing is not standard practice. Most patients are treated according to treatment protocols, with a fixed dose administered at fixed time intervals. Although the between-subject variability in the volume of distribution is small, there is a moderate to high between-subject variability in the clearance of these biologics. The formation of neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) further contributes to the variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. After the development of assays to detect biologic drug serum concentrations and ADA titers, the first clinical studies in immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology have now shown clear concentration-effect relationships. By monitoring the serum trough concentrations of biologics, patients with high drug exposure could be identified and dose reductions in those patients may lead to improved safety and substantial cost savings. Low biologic drug serum concentrations may be due to the development of ADAs, and if these are detected, a switch to an alternative treatment is indicated. We envision a vast expansion of therapeutic drug monitoring to support the use of biologics, and we urge the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology to embark on initiatives to investigate the contribution of therapeutic drug monitoring to this field.

Abstract 626. Title: A single-center, retrospective analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of filgrastim-sndz to filgrastim for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and for neutrophil recovery following autologous stem cell transplantation.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28990128
Abstract: Filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio®) was approved by the FDA in March 2015 as a biosimilar product of its reference product, filgrastim (Neupogen®) for all five indications. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines has incorporated filgrastim-sndz into its recommendations as a category 1 recommendation for use in settings of febrile neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy administration, and post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). As a cost-saving initiative, our institution switched from filgrastim to filgrastim-sndz for all indications starting in March 2016. The purpose of this study was to assess for any difference in clinical or safety outcomes between filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz. This is an IRB-approved, single institution, 1-year retrospective chart review (September 2015 to August 2016) conducted in hospitalized adults who received either filgrastim or filgrastim-sndz either for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression or for neutrophil recovery after autologous HSCT. Our data showed no differences in duration of G-CSF therapy (7.96 vs. 8.5 days, P = 0.36), white blood count (WBC) (8.99 vs. 8.04, P = 0.28), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (7.62 vs. 6.91 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, P = 0.36) at the time of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) discontinuation, or safety of filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz. The efficacy and safety of filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz were similar for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and neutrophil recovery post-autologous HSCT.

Abstract 627. Title: Incidence of Serious Infections and Design of Utilization and Safety Studies for Biologic and Biosimilar Surveillance.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223608
Abstract: There is a need for postmarketing evidence generation for novel biologics and biosimilars.
To assess the feasibility, strengths, and limitations of the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) Distributed Research Network (DRN) to examine the utilization and comparative safety of immune-modulating agents among patients with autoimmune diseases.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients enrolled in health insurance plans participating in the BBCIC DRN between January 1, 2006, and September 30, 2015. Eligible patients were adult (≥18 years) new users of a disease-modifying nonbiologic and/or biologic agent with a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other inflammatory conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Follow-up started at treatment initiation and ended at the earliest of outcome occurrence (serious infection); treatment discontinuation; or switching, death, disenrollment, or end of study period. The study leveraged the FDA Sentinel System infrastructure for data management and analysis; descriptive statistics of patient characteristics and unadjusted incidence rates of study outcomes during follow-up were calculated.
Eligible patient drug episodes included 111,611 with RA (75% female), 61,050 with other inflammatory conditions (51% female), and 30,628 with IBD (52% female). Across all 3 cohorts, approximately half of the patient drug episodes initiated a biologic (50% in RA; 60% in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis; and 55% in IBD). The crude incidence rate of serious infection was 9.8 (9.5-10.0) cases per 100 person-years in RA, 7.1 (6.8-7.5) in other inflammatory conditions, and 14.2 (13.6-14.8) in IBD patients.
This study successfully identified large numbers of new users of biologics and produced results that were consistent with those from earlier published studies. The BBCIC DRN is a potential resource for surveillance of biologics.

Abstract 628. Title: On safety margin for drug interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2017-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27911675
Abstract: As more and more generic (or biosimilar) drug products become available in the market place, it is a concern whether the approved generic (or biosimilar) drug products are safe and efficacious and hence can be used interchangeably. According to current regulation, most regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicate an approved generic (or biosimilar) drug product can serve as a substitute for the innovative drug product. Bioequivalence (biosimilarity) assessment for regulatory approval among generic copies (or biosimilars) of the innovative drug product are not required. In practice, approved generic (or biosimilar) drugs are commonly used interchangeably without any mechanism of safety monitoring. In this article, current bioequivalence (or biosimilarity) limit is adjusted according to the observed geometric mean ratio and corresponding variability for development of safety margins for monitoring of drug interchangeability by minimizing the relative change in response with and without the switching.

Abstract 629. Title: Insights on the use of biosimilars in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-21
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28373759
Abstract: Biologic therapy, such as those that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, has proven to be an efficacious method of treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with regards to symptom management and mucosal healing. However, the rising prevalence of IBD worldwide and the ever-increasing burden of biologic pharmaceuticals in the health care industry is alarming for insurance companies, clinicians, and patients. The impending patent expiry and the relatively high costs of biologics, particularly anti-TNF agents, have paved the way for biosimilar development for IBD. The United States Food and Drug Administration defines a biosimilar as a biological product that is highly similar to its reference medicinal product, with no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency. The hope with biosimilars is that their entry into the market will be able to drive competition between pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices like that of the generic market, and that access to appropriate biologic treatments for IBD patients is increased in the long-term. Yet, there are challenging issues such as indication extrapolation and interchangeability that are still being debated in the field of IBD and must be addressed in future issued guidance. This review will discuss the issues and implications concerning the use of biosimilar therapy for IBD.

Abstract 630. Title: Are Biosimilars the Future of Oncology and Haematology?
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541401
Abstract: Biological drugs are vital but often high-cost components of cancer treatment. Several biosimilar versions of these drugs have been approved in Europe and/or the USA, with many more in development. However, there is some disconnect between the biosimilars that are approved for use and those accessible in clinical practice, with availability impacted by factors including patent litigation and complex healthcare insurance policies, particularly in the USA. Provided the barriers to widespread uptake can be overcome, biosimilars offer potential benefits including cost savings and improved patient access versus the reference product (RP). This article provides an up-to-date and focused perspective on the development and use of biosimilars in the haemato-oncology setting. European and US regulatory pathways governing biosimilar licensing demand that there are no clinically meaningful differences between a biosimilar and its RP. Pathways are rigorously enforced and involve comprehensive non-clinical evaluations and clinical trials in selected indications to establish the equivalence or non-inferiority of efficacy, and the comparability of safety, of the biosimilar versus its RP. 'Indication extrapolation' is only permitted if scientifically justifiable considering mechanism(s) of action, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety in relevant patient populations. Switching treatment from RP to biosimilar is supported by most available data, predominantly from indications other than cancer, and post-marketing pharmacovigilance programmes are warranted. Notably, the potential benefits of biosimilar cancer treatment may extend beyond direct cost savings: for example, the availability of biosimilars of common regimen components may help incentivise the evaluation and/or clinical use of new treatment approaches and novel drugs.

Abstract 631. Title: Considerations for the US health-system pharmacist in a world of biosimilars.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32158487
Abstract: As numerous biosimilar products are forecast to enter the US market in the coming years, health-system pharmacists will be faced with novel challenges while incorporating them into clinical practice. The current regulatory approval framework and guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration do not address many real-world scenarios that pharmacists will encounter. We provide an overview of the evolving healthcare landscape shaped by the entry of multiple biosimilars, including for a given reference product, and their impact on the health-system pharmacist with respect to formulary assessment, implementation, and education of various health-system stakeholders, including patients.

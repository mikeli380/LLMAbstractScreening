# LLMAbstractScreening

This code repository contains the abstract texts and inclusion results used for three systematic review studies, Bannach-Brown 2016, Menon 2022, and Meijboom 2021. Also, included are the automation scripts to call various large language model API's to screen the abstracts. In addition, the code for a latent class analysis model that models the results for a majority-voting scheme has been included.

Inclusion Criteria: 1. Any article providing primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype with an appropriate control group (specified above). 2. Animals of all ages, sexes and species, where depression-like phenotype intended to mimic the human condition have been induced. Including animal models where depressive-like phenotypes are induced in the presence of a comorbidity (e.g. obesity or cancer). 3. All studies that claim to model depression or depressive-like phenotypes in animals. Studies that induce depressive behaviour or model depression and that also test a treatment or intervention (prior or subsequent to model induction), with no exclusion criteria based on dosage, timing or frequency. 4. Studies measuring behavioural, anatomical and structural, electrophysiological, histological and/or neurochemical outcomes and where genomic, proteomic or metabolomic outcomes are measured in addition to behavioural, anatomical, electrophysiological, histological or neurochemical outcomes.Exclusion Criteria: 1. Review article, editorials, case reports, letters or comments, conference or seminar abstracts, studies providing primary data but not appropriate control group. 2. Human studies and ex vivo, in vitro or in silico studies. Studies will be excluded if authors state an intention to induce or investigate only anxiety or anxious behaviour. Studies will be excluded if there is no experimental intervention on the animals (e.g. purely observational studies). 3. Studies that investigate treatments or interventions, but no depressive behaviour or model of depression is induced (e.g. toxicity and side-effect studies). 4. Where metabolic outcome measures are the primary outcome measure of a study. Where genomic, proteomic, metabolic or metabolomic outcomes are the sole outcome measures in a study, they will be excluded.

Title: Similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of adalimumab biosimilar BI 695501 and Humira reference product in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis: results from the phase III randomised VOLTAIRE-RA equivalence study.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514803
Abstract: To demonstrate clinical equivalence of adalimumab biosimilar candidate BI 695501 with Humira.
Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis on stable methotrexate were randomised to BI 695501 or Humira in a double-blind, parallel-group, equivalence study. At week 24, patients were rerandomised to continue BI 695501 or Humira, or switch from Humira to BI 695501. The coprimary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) at weeks 12 and 24. Further efficacy and safety endpoints and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 58.
645 patients were randomised. At week 12, 67.0% and 61.1% (90% CI -0.9 to 12.7) of patients receiving BI 695501 (n=324) and Humira (n=321), respectively, achieved ACR20; at week 24 the corresponding values were 69.0% and 64.5% (95% CI -3.4 to 12.5). These differences were within prespecified margins (week 12: 90% CI (-12% to 15%); week 24: 95% CI (-15% to 15%)), demonstrating therapeutic bioequivalence. 593 patients were rerandomised at week 24. Up to week 48, mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates were similar across the switched (n=147), continuous BI 695501 (n=298) and continuous Humira (n=148) groups. Similar immunogenicity (antidrug antibodies (ADAs), ADA titres and neutralising antibodies) was seen between BI 695501 and Humira (to week 24) and across rerandomised groups (to week 48). Safety and tolerability profiles were similar between groups.
BI 695501 demonstrated similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to Humira; switch from Humira to BI 695501 had no impact on efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.

Title: Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Ustekinumab, Infliximab, or Adalimumab for the Treatment of Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease in Biologic-Naïve Patients.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30565265
Abstract: Ustekinumab was recently approved by the United States U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In this analysis, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab, infliximab, or adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-severe Crohn's disease in patients who failed conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and immunomodulators) but were naïve to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (i.e., biologic drugs).
Cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model structure (decision tree and Markov model).
A decision tree simulated biologic induction, and a Markov model simulated biologic and conventional therapy maintenance. Cycle length was 2 weeks with a discounted 5-year time horizon and a limited U.S. societal perspective in the base case; results from a payer perspective are also reported. Transition probabilities, direct costs, indirect costs, and utilities were obtained from the literature. To measure relative treatment value (i.e., order of treatment cost-effectiveness), net monetary benefits were reported for a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case. Infliximab dominated both adalimumab and ustekinumab, with a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $9943 and $29,798, respectively, in the base case. Adalimumab dominated ustekinumab, with an NMB of $19,855. All biologics yielded similar quality-adjusted life-years (~3.5), whereas costs varied substantially ($50,510, $54,985, and $72,921 for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, respectively). The payer perspective, alternate time horizons, and scenario analyses consistently showed infliximab dominance. One-way, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results with respect to all parameters. Although biosimilars were not explicitly modeled as comparators, one-way sensitivity analysis showed that drug acquisition costs could alter relative treatment value but would have to be varied by at least 50%.
For moderate-severe Crohn's disease, infliximab yields significantly more NMBs compared with both adalimumab and ustekinumab. Additional clinical (e.g., empiric dosing, biologic cycling) and quality-of-life (e.g., lost productivity, disutility of home injections) research is needed to allow for model frameworks and parameters that more accurately reflect the nuances of Crohn's disease treatment.

Title: Biosimilars and Novel Insulins.
Publication Date: 2020-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31764128
Abstract: Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes and may be necessary in type 2 diabetes. Current insulin analogues present a more physiological profile, are effective, and with less risk of hypoglycemia, but they are expensive. Biosimilar insulins should offer the advantages of insulin analogues at reduced costs. In addition, current rapid-acting insulin analogues are not fast enough to control excessive postprandial glucose excursions in many patients.
Biosimilar insulins demonstrated that are safe and effective, but interchangeability and automatic substitution remain an issue. Ultrafast-acting insulins should reduce postprandial hyperglycemia and improve flexibility in insulin dosing.
This systematic review was conducted following widely recommended methods. We searched for each topic in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and SCISEARCH for relevant citations for the appropriate period.
LY2963016 and MK-1293 are biosimilar insulins of insulin glargine, and SAR342434 is a biosimilar of insulin lispro. The abbreviated developed program demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety and supports their use for treatment of people with diabetes but no interchangeability. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a new formulation of insulin aspart with accelerated subcutaneous absorption. Faster aspart demonstrated noninferiority in reducing HbA1c as compared to insulin aspart with superiority in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing hypoglycemia, and flexible insulin dosing.
Biosimilar insulins have comparable PK-PD profiles and equivalent efficacy and safety to original insulins at a lower price, making them available for more people with diabetes. Faster aspart is the first ultrafast-acting insulin. New upcoming clinical trials and more clinical experience with faster aspart will show the real potential of this new insulin.

Title: Biosimilars in rheumatology.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568820
Abstract: Biotechnologicals are an invaluable resource in the treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) non-responsive or intolerant to conventional therapies. However, they are the main driver for increase in direct costs and represent a significant economic burden to healthcare systems worldwide. Since biosimilars are similar and more affordable versions of previously licenced biotechnologicals, they are expected to contribute to healthcare system sustainability and reduce inequities in treatment access. The landmark approval of CT-P13 as the first infliximab biosimilar paved the way for new infliximab but also etanercept, adalimumab and rituximab biosimilars. In Europe, North America and some countries of Asia, development is strictly regulated and only those presenting a totality-of-evidence dossier with highly similar physicochemical, biological and clinical performances are endorsed by regulatory agencies as biosimilars. The current article addresses the importance of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of IRD, as well as their innovative development and regulatory pathways, clinical evidence of similarity and challenges that may undermine their widespread use and success.

Title: Health technology assessment of biosimilars worldwide: a scoping review.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-26
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32843051
Abstract: Health technology assessment (HTA) should provide an assessment of a technology's effects on health and of the related social, economic, organisational and ethical issues. HTA reports on biosimilars can specifically assess their immunogenicity, their extrapolation to one or more conditions, and the risks of interchangeability and substitution. We aimed to complete a scoping review within the context of HTA organisations to synthesise HTA reports on biosimilars and to map the extension, scope and methodological practices.
A scoping review methodology was applied. The sources for biosimilars HTA reports were database searches and grey literature from HTA organisation websites up to June 2019. HTA reports of biosimilars were classified as full HTA, mini-HTA or rapid reviews. Data were extracted and recorded on a calibrated predefined data form. We identified 70 HTA reports of biosimilars of 16 biologic products (65.71% in 2015-2018) produced by 13 HTA organisations from 10 countries; 2 full HTAs, 4 mini-HTAs and 64 rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria. Almost all the rapid reviews gave no information regarding any evidence synthesis method and approximately half of the rapid reviews did not appraise the risk of bias of primary studies or the overall quality of evidence. All full-HTAs and mini-HTAs addressed organisational, ethical, social and legal considerations, while these factors were assessed in less than half of the rapid reviews. The immunogenicity and extrapolation of one or more conditions were often considered. The majority of full-HTAs and mini-HTAs contained an assessment of switching and a discussion of an educational approach about biosimilars. No HTA report rejected the adoption/reimbursement of the biosimilar assessed.
HTA of biosimilars are emerging in the context of HTA organisations and those that exist often duplicate reports of the same biosimilar. Most HTA reports of biosimilars do not conduct a systematic literature review or consider economic issues. No report has rejected the adoption/reimbursement of biosimilars. There is a need to standardise the minimum criteria for the development of HTA on biosimilars to ensure a better understanding and better decision-making.

Title: Recommendations on the use of biosimilars by the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, Brazilian Society of Dermatology, Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology and Brazilian Study Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease--Focus on clinical evaluation of monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Publication Date: 2015-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25936608
Abstract: The Brazilian Societies of Rheumatology (SBR) and Dermatology (SBD), the Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology (FBG) and the Brazilian Study Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GEDIIB) gathered a group of their respective specialists on the topic of interest to discuss the most relevant issues regarding the clinical use of biosimilar medicines in Brazil. The main aim of that meeting was to prepare a document with recommendations to guide medical specialists and to help the national regulatory and policy-making agencies as concerns the authorization for marketing biosimilars used in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to considerations on the typical differences between innovator medicines and biosimilars, the specialists established a set of seven recommendations on regulatory advances related to clinical studies, indication extrapolation, nomenclature, interchangeability, automatic substitution and pharmacovigilance.

Title: Frequency and characteristics of infusion reactions during biosimilar infliximab treatment in inflammatory bowel diseases: results from Central European nationwide cohort.
Publication Date: 2017-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504555
Abstract: Safety data of the 'real life' use of an infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are still lacking. Our aim was to assess the frequency and characteristics of infusion reactions during CT-P13 therapy in 13 Hungarian and 1 Czech IBD centres.
Clinical and safety data was registered at fixed appointments. Trough levels and anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentration were measured by ELISA. Association between demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and infusion reaction rates were evaluated statistically.
Three hundred and eighty-four IBD patients were included. Twenty-eight Hungarian IBD patients (9.6%) developed infusion reaction during the treatment, 64.3% of them was previously exposed to anti TNF therapy. No infusion reaction occurred in the Czech population. CT-P13 therapy had to be stopped in 17 patients who developed infusion reaction and was switched to adalimumab in 12 patients. However in 39.3% of patients developing infusion reaction CT-P13 therapy was continued with the use of premedication. Cumulative ADA positivity rates were 8.7%, 19.3%, and 28.0% at weeks 0, 14, and 30. Previous anti-TNF-alpha exposure (30% vs. 3.1%, p < 0.001, OR 6.3 (2.7-14.6)) and ADA positivity (32.6% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.001, OR 19(5-73)) during the induction therapy were predictive factors for infusion reactions.
Patients with previous exposure to anti-TNF-alpha and ADA positivity during the induction therapy were more likely to develop infusion reactions.

Title: The Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Switching Between Reference Biopharmaceuticals and Biosimilars: A Systematic Review.
Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32236956
Abstract: To date, no consensus exists among stakeholders about switching patients between reference biological products (RPs) and biosimilars, which may have been curbing the implementation of biosimilars in clinical practice. This study synthesizes the available data on switching and assesses whether switching patients from a RP to its biosimilar or vice versa affects efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity outcomes. A total of 178 studies, in which switch outcomes from a RP to a biosimilar were reported, was identified. Data were derived from both randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence. Despite the limitations stemming from a lack of a robust design for most of the studies, the available switching data do not indicate that switching from a RP to a biosimilar is associated with any major efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity issues. Some open-label and observational studies reported increased discontinuation rates after switching, which were mainly attributed to nocebo effects. Involvement of the prescriber in any decision to switch should remain and attention should be paid to the mitigation of a potential nocebo effect.

Title: [Appropriate use of trastuzumab in Lazio Region: therapeutic scenarios and estimation of possible savings for the Regional Health Service.].
Publication Date: 2019-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31909763
Abstract: The availability of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (EV) formulations of trastuzumab and the recent release of the biosimilar EV version (10/2018) increase the offer for the treatment of patients with breast or gastric cancer HER2 positive. In this context, it is necessary to build therapeutic scenarios form avalible data in order to estimate the potential savings for the Regional Health Service (RHS) taking into account the appropriateness of use and patient's preferences.
To evaluate the available comparative evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the different trastuzumab formulations; to analyze the supply of trastuzumab by type of administration (EV/SC) in Lazio in 2018, identifying the most appropriate use; to hypothesize a cost-effective scenario for the Regional Health Service (SSR) in 2019. Mehods. With the working group formed by clinicians and methodologists, we analysed the evidence of efficacy and safety available to date for the different formulations of trastuzumab, also taking into account the recent availability of biosimilars and with particular regard to the phenomenon of the potential switch between different therapeutic options. In addition, for the year 2019 the available economic impact assessments were also simulated with data from the Lazio Region. Through the datas from direct pharmaceutical products, the transtuzumab cycles supplied in 2018 were identified separately for the available formulations (EV/SC). For each cycle of therapy, starting from the date of delivery, the possible presence of a concomitant treatment (± 2 days) was investigated, tracing the type and method of administration. The treatments (concomitant with trastuzumab) were identified for which there were conflicting modes of administration. In addition, the supply of SC per dispensing structure was evaluated and, on the basis of this information, a scenario of use was hypothesized that takes into account costs and plausible consumption.
A review of the literature summarized the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of the use of trastuzumab in the recorded therapeutic indications. The review was discussed with the working group and used to reproduce, at regional level, the estimates of the economic impact of the different therapeutic choices possible with trastuzumab. As regards the data on the use of trastuzumab, in the Lazio Region in 2018, 22,214 treatment cycles were observed (at a cost of 33 million euro) for 2,407 patients; new users accounted for 52.2%. 46.8% of the cycles were administered via SC; the use of the biosimilar was observed from October onwards and involved 143 cycles (0.6%). In 68.4% of the cycles trastuzumab was administered in monotherapy; among the therapies associated with trastuzumab, the most frequent was pertuzumab (n=4,258, 19.2% of the total cycles), followed by paclitaxel (n=1,364, 6.1% of the total cycles). Among the cycles of trastuzumab in concomitant therapy (N=7,022), 17.3% was administered via SC despite the presence of other drugs administered via EV. The prescriptive pattern of trastuzumab was heterogeneous for the different delivery structures. The SC administration presents a variability in the supply from 26% to 70% (interquartile range) and does not seem to be related to the type and volume of activity of the hospital. If the biosimilar EV is expected to account for 55% of consumption by 2019, thus reducing the use of the EV originator to 10% and the SC originator to 35%, savings of more than €7 million.
Through the use data of the different formulations available for trastuzumab and taking into account the prescriptive appropriateness (and patient preferences), it has been possible to identify a SSR scenario of economic convenience due to the greater use of the biosimilar.

Title: Safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of switching from innovator to biosimilar infliximab in patients with spondyloarthritis: a 6-month real-life observational study.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449503
Abstract: Biosimilar infliximab (INX) was recently approved by the European Medicine Agency for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and psoriasis on the grounds that its pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy were comparable to those of innovator INX. The aim of this study was to investigate the real-life efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of switching from innovator to biosimilar INX in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Forty-one patients attending three Italian rheumatology centres with a previous diagnosis of SpA and clinically inactive or moderate disease activity (ASDAS-CRP < 2.1; 22 with AS, five with enteropathic arthritis, 10 with PsA, and four with undifferentiated SpA), who had been treated for more than 6 months with innovator INX in accordance with the ASAS/EULAR guidelines, were switched to biosimilar INX for pharmaco-economic reasons (Tuscany Law No. 450 of 7 April 2015) and followed up for 6 months. A record was kept of their BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS-CRP, DAS28-CRP (in the presence of peripheral disease), MASES, VAS pain scores, the duration of morning stiffness, and adverse events (AEs). At the time of the switch, the patients had a median age of 50.9 years (range 23-80), a median disease duration of 124.5 months (range 14-372), and a median duration of treatment with innovator INX of 73.7 months (range 6-144). After 6 months of biosimilar INX therapy, there were no statistical differences in their median BASDAI (2.73 ± 1.5 vs. 2.6 ± 1.3, p = .27), BASFI (2.34 ± 1.3 vs. 2.17 ± 1.2, p = 0.051), ASDAS-CRP (1.35 ± 0.3 vs. 1.28 ± 0.2, p = 0.24), DAS28-CRP (2.66 ± 0.67 vs. 2.67 ± 0.35, p = 0.92), MASES (0.35 ± 0.7 vs. 0.17 ± 0.4, p = 0.08), or VAS pain scores (18 ± 14.7 vs. 16.7 ± 11.3, p = 0.55), whereas the median duration of morning stiffness had significantly decreased (7.2 ± 6.9 vs. 5.8 ± 6, p = 0.02). Furthermore, there was no change in circulating INX (4.22 ± 2.89 vs 4.84 ± 2.86 μg/mL, p = 0.80) or anti-INX antibody levels (27.76 ± 17.13 vs 27.27 ± 17.28 ng/mL, p = 0.98). The switch from innovator to biosimilar INX in this Italian multicentre SpA cohort was not associated with any statistically significance differences in efficacy, adverse events or anti-drug antibody level.

This 51-week double-blinded, phase III study randomly assigned patients to GP2017 (n = 231) or ref-ADMB (n = 234) 80 mg subcutaneously at week 0, then 40 mg biweekly from week 1. At week 17, patients were rerandomized to switch (n = 126) or continue (n = 253) treatment. The primary end point was patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16, with equivalence confirmed if the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in PASI 75 between treatments was ± 18%. The key secondary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in continuous PASI. Other end points were PASI over time; PASI 50, 75, 90 and100; pharmacokinetics; safety; tolerability and immunogenicity for the switched and continued treatment groups.
Equivalent efficacy between GP2017 and ref-ADMB was confirmed for the primary (66·8% and 65·0%, respectively; 95% CI -7·46 to 11·15) and key secondary end points (-60·7% and -61·5%, respectively; 95% CI -3·15 to 4·84). PASI improved over time and was similar between treatment groups at week 16, and the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. There were no relevant safety or immunogenicity differences between GP2017 and ref-ADMB at week 16, or the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. No hypersensitivity to adalimumab was reported upon switching.
Following the demonstration of GP2017 biosimilarity to ref-ADMB, switching up to four times between GP2017 and ref-ADMB had no detectable impact on efficacy, safety or immunogenicity.

Title: Efficacy and safety of MYL-1501D versus insulin glargine in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Results of the INSTRIDE 3 phase 3 switch study.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691472
Abstract: To assess the efficacy, insulin dose, safety and immunogenicity when people with type 1 diabetes mellitus switched between MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine (Lantus®; Sanofi-Aventis US LLC, Bridgewater, New Jersey).
Eligible participants from INSTRIDE 1 who completed 52 weeks of reference insulin glargine treatment were randomized 1:1 to the reference sequence (n = 63; reference insulin glargine for 36 weeks) or to the treatment-switching sequence (n = 64; MYL-1501D [weeks 0-12], reference insulin glargine [weeks 12-24] and MYL-1501D [weeks 24-36]). Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 36 was the primary efficacy endpoint used to demonstrate equivalence between the two treatment sequences. Secondary endpoints included: change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin dose; immunogenicity; and adverse events, including hypoglycaemia.
Mean changes in HbA1c (least squares [LS] mean [SE]) from baseline to week 36 were -0.05 (0.032) and -0.06 (0.034) for the treatment-switching and reference sequences, respectively (LS mean difference 0.01 [95% CI -0.085 to 0.101]). Treatment sequences were comparable in terms of secondary endpoints, including FPG, SMBG and insulin dose, and the safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two sequences were similar.
Switching participants between MYL-1501D and reference insulin glargine demonstrated equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity, showing that people taking reference insulin glargine can safely switch to MYL-1501D.

Title: Switching from Remicade® to Remsima® is well Tolerated and Feasible: A Prospective, Open-label Study.
Publication Date: 2017-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27660339
Abstract: A biosimilar version of infliximab [CT-P13/Remsima®] recently entered the European market. The clinical data on its use in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are sparse, especially on switching from the originator Remicade®. In this study, we aimed to prospectively investigate the feasibility, safety and immunogenicity of switching from Remicade to Remsima in a real-life IBD population.
All adult patients who were treated with Remicade in the Department of Gastroenterology at Oslo University Hospital were switched to Remsima. The follow-up lasted for 6 months. In addition, a retrospective registration was performed with a start time of 6 months before switching drugs. The primary endpoints were [i] the proportion of patients remaining on medication 6 months after switching and [ii] adverse events during the 6 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included [i] disease activity scores [Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Partial Mayo Score], C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval, and p-infliximab and [ii] the development of antidrug antibodies.
In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. The large majority [97%] remained on the medication throughout follow-up. A low number of adverse events were observed. No change in disease activity, C-reactive protein, haemoglobin, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval or p-infliximab was detected. Three patients developed new detectable antidrug antibodies.
Switching from Remicade to Remsima was feasible and with few adverse events, including very limited antidrug antibody formation and loss of response.

Title: The US approach to biosimilars: the long-awaited FDA approval pathway.
Publication Date: 2012-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030677
Abstract: In the US, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act, 2009) provided the pathway to create an abbreviated licensure procedure for biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed biologic product. In February 2012, the FDA issued three guidelines that list the requirements for biosimilar registration. The topics covered include scientific and quality considerations to demonstrate biosimilarity to a reference product and a guidance that clarifies the BPCI Act implementation. The sponsor application for the biosimilar approval must contain biosimilarity information based on data derived from analytical, animal, and clinical studies. Clinical studies should include an assessment of immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and address one or more indications licensed for the reference product. To demonstrate biosimilarity the applicant is allowed to use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-US-licensed product. According to these guidelines, the FDA will consider different aspects when evaluating biosimilarity, such as product formulation, complexity, and stability which will have a risk-based approach and will depend on the degree of knowledge of the product characteristics, as well as clinical experience with the reference one. The FDA intends to use a risk-based and facts-focused approach for review of applications of biosimilars, although it faces several challenges. Once a biologic medicine has been demonstrated to be biosimilar to the reference product, an abridged development program for the biosimilar medicine can be carried out in a similar way to that established by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, FDA legislation goes a step further than the EMA, offering the possibility to adopt full interchangeability for biosimilars.

Title: Safety and efficacy of rituximab biosimilar (CT-P10) in systemic sclerosis: an Italian multicentre study.
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32413118
Abstract: Recent data have shown a significant efficacy of rituximab (RTX) in SSc. An RTX biosimilar (RTX-B) is a more affordable option. We assessed the safety and efficacy of an RTX-B (CT-P10) in SSc.
SSc patients treated with RTX-B with at least 6 months of follow-up were retrospectively identified from six Italian referral centres. SSc patients naïve to RTX-B (RTX-Bn) or already treated with RTX originator and switched to an RTX-B (RTX-Bs) were evaluated. A comprehensive assessment of disease characteristics and organ involvement at baseline and after 6 months was obtained.
Thirty-three SSc patients were selected: 29 (87.9%) females, mean age 51.6 years (s.d. 14.2), mean disease duration 9.8 years (s.d. 8.1); 21 (64.5%) with dcSSc, 20 (60.1%) anti-topoisomerase I, 7 (21.2%) anti-RNA polymerase III and 6 (18.2%) anti-centromere positive. Seventeen (51.5%) were RTX-Bn and 16 were on RTX-Bs (48.5%). RTX was introduced because of skin progression in 18 patients (54.5%), interstitial lung disease (ILD) worsening in 11 (33.3%) and arthritis in 12 (36.4%). All patients were previously treated with immunosuppressants. At RTX-B introduction, 21 (63.6%) patients were on concomitant immunosuppressants: 15 (71.4%) on MMF and 6 (28.6%) on MTX. Twenty-three (69.7%) were on low-dose steroids. After 6 months, a significant reduction of the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), 28-joint DAS and CRP was observed (P = 0.002, 0.005 and 0.008, respectively); the mRSS significantly improved both in RTX-Bn (P < 0.024) and RTX-Bs patients (P < 0.031). No significant changes were observed for lung function tests, either in the entire cohort or in the subgroup of ILD patients. Only one RTX-Bs patient experienced transient neutropenia.
Our data suggest that RTX-B can represent a cheaper option in SSc patients, as it is effective in improving skin and joint involvement and in stabilizing lung function.

Title: Similar names for similar biologics.
Publication Date: 2014-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25001080
Abstract: Approval of the first biosimilar in the USA may occur by the end of 2014, yet a naming approach for biosimilars has not been determined. Biosimilars are highly similar to their biologic reference product but are not identical to it, because of their structural complexity and variations in manufacturing processes among companies. There is a need for a naming approach that can distinguish a biosimilar from its reference product and other biosimilars and ensure accurate tracing of adverse events (AEs) to the administered product. In contrast, generic small-molecule drugs are identical to their reference product and, therefore, share the same nonproprietary name. Clinical trials required to demonstrate biosimilarity for approval may not detect rare AEs or those occurring after prolonged use, and the incidence of such events may differ between a biosimilar and its reference product. The need for precise biologic identification is further underscored by the possibility of biosimilar interchangeability, a US designation that will allow substitution without prescriber intervention. For several biologics, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has used a naming approach that adds a prefix to a common root nonproprietary name, enabling healthcare providers to distinguish between products, avoid medication errors, and facilitate pharmacovigilance. We recommend that the FDA implement a biosimilars naming policy that likewise would add a distinguishable prefix or suffix to the root nonproprietary name of the reference product. This approach would ensure that a biosimilar could be distinguished from its reference product and other biosimilars in patient records and pharmacovigilance databases/reports, facilitating accurate attribution of AEs.

Title: Assessing biosimilar education needs among oncology pharmacy practitioners worldwide: An ISOPP membership survey.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268832
Abstract: The International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners (ISOPP) Biosimilar Task Force was charged to develop educational resources to address the learning needs related to biosimilars use of oncology pharmacy practitioners. To facilitate the process, the task force conducted a survey in order to identify unmet education needs as well as barriers for obtaining biosimilar education among oncology pharmacy practitioners.
A cross sectional survey was conducted between 10 December 2018 and 18 February 2019. Members of International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners and national oncology pharmacy groups were invited to complete the survey. The survey contained 22 items and consisted of four sections. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the survey results.
A total of 363 International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members were surveyed, with 75 members providing a response (response rate = 21%). In addition, 11 non-International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members also participated in the survey, bringing the total to 86 respondents. The top three areas in which respondents reported learning needs included evaluating comparative efficacy of a biosimilar to an originator’s product (74.4%), managing the switchover to a biosimilar from the original product (74.4%), and understanding medication safety issues in relation to biosimilars use (73.3%). The most common challenges faced in obtaining education on biosimilars included limited financial support for education on biosimilar products (38.4%), heavy workload (31.4%), and inadequate educational resources (27.9%).
This survey has identified numerous biosimilar learning needs as well as challenges faced in obtaining biosimilars education among oncology pharmacy practitioners. Educational activities should be created to address these learning needs, and innovative strategies should be considered to overcome practitioner’s barriers in obtaining biosimilars education.

Title: Long-term Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of the Infliximab (IFX) Biosimilar, PF-06438179/GP1111, in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis After Switching from Reference IFX or Continuing Biosimilar Therapy: Week 54-78 Data From a Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31939063
Abstract: Our objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the infliximab biosimilar, PF-06438179/GP1111 (PF-SZ-IFX), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who continued biosimilar treatment throughout 78 weeks or who switched from reference infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) sourced from the EU (IFX-EU) at week 30 or week 54 in the REFLECTIONS B537-02 study.
In this phase III, double-blind, active-controlled study, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA were initially randomized to PF-SZ-IFX or IFX-EU, each with methotrexate (treatment period [TP] 1; N = 650). At week 30, patients receiving PF-SZ-IFX continued PF-SZ-IFX; patients receiving IFX-EU were re-randomized to continue IFX-EU or switch to PF-SZ-IFX (TP2; n = 566). From weeks 54 to 78, all patients received open-label treatment with PF-SZ-IFX (TP3; n = 505). Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity data were analyzed during TP3.
Efficacy was sustained and comparable across groups at week 78, with American College of Rheumatology criteria for ≥ 20% clinical improvement response rates of 75.9% (biosimilar group), 77.8% (week 30 switch group), and 68.3% (week 54 switch group). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 28.9%, 29.4%, and 30.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients who were antidrug antibody (ADA) positive and neutralizing antibody positive (as a percentage of ADA-positive patients) was stable and comparable between groups.
Results to week 78 continue to support the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PF-SZ-IFX in patients with moderate-to-severe active RA. There were no clinically meaningful differences between groups, independent of a single treatment transition from IFX-EU to PF-SZ-IFX at week 30 or week 54.

PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065599
Abstract: In the last decade, discussions on the development of the regulatory framework of generic versions of complex drugs such as biologicals and non-biological complex drugs have attracted broad attention. The terminology used is far from harmonized and can lead to multiple interpretations of legal texts, reflection papers, and guidance documents regarding market introduction as well as reimbursement. This article describes the meaning of relevant terms in different global regions (Europe, USA, WHO) and offers a proposal for a globally accepted terminology regarding (non-) biological complex drugs.

Title: Potential Cost Implications of Mandatory Non-Medical Switching Policies for Biologics for Rheumatic Conditions and Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32909249
Abstract: In 2018, TNFα inhibitors were the highest cost drug class for Canadian public drug programs. In 2019, two Canadian provinces announced mandatory nonmedical switching policies in an attempt to reduce their costs by increasing biosimilar uptake. The national impact of similar policies across Canada is unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of monthly publicly funded prescription claims for infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab between June 2015 and December 2019. We reported the market share of biosimilars for infliximab and etanercept in 2019 for each province and estimated the cost savings that public payers could have realized in 2019 if mandatory switching policies had been implemented across Canada, including a sensitivity analysis, which assumed that governments receive a 25% rebate on all biologics. Provincial drug programs spent CAD $991.84 million on infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab in 2019, and, when biosimilars were available, they constituted only 15.5% of national utilization of these drugs. In British Columbia, the implementation of a mandatory switching policy for patients with rheumatic conditions increased the biosimilar market share of infliximab and etanercept by 299% (from 19.7% to 78.5%). If applied nationwide to all three biologics for all indications, we estimate such policies could lead to annual savings of between CAD $179.71 million and CAD $425.64 million nationally. The overall market share of biosimilars remains low in all provinces where mandatory switching policies have not been introduced. The cost implications of successfully increasing biosimilar uptake would be substantial, particularly as more biosimilars reach the Canadian market.

Title: Integrating trastuzumab biosimilars and HER2-directed therapies into HER2-positive breast cancer management.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32282173
Abstract: The approval of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in 1998 changed the trajectory of treatment and subsequent outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and is now the standard of care in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. However, as with most biologic drugs, trastuzumab comes with a relatively high price tag compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and contributes to healthcare budgets. Three engineered products related to trastuzumab-2 antibody-drug conjugates, ado-trastuzumab emtansine and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, as well as the subcutaneous trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-have since been approved and have expanded the treatment options for this patient population. The approval of 5 trastuzumab biosimilars as of the end of 2019 holds the promise of considerable cost savings, but challenges to integrating their use into patient care must be addressed. Barriers to their use, including physician uncertainty to switch patients from the reference drug to the therapeutic biosimilar and patients' lack of understanding about biosimilars, are common in the United States. It is also important that all stakeholders, including managed care professionals, pharmacists, and practice administrators, understand how to incorporate trastuzumab biosimilars into formulary discussions, clinical care plans and processes, and educational initiatives for healthcare providers and patients.

Title: Switching Between Epoetins: A Practice in Support of Biosimilar Use.
Publication Date: 2016-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26728875
Abstract: The acceptability of switching between reference drugs and their biosimilars is often disputed. It is unclear whether this concern is specific to the use of biosimilars or is relevant to the practice of switching between any biological drugs.
The objective of this study was to quantify the occurrence of switching between different erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
A retrospective drug utilization study was conducted in the Umbria region (Italy). The study population included all residents who received their first epoetin prescription between 1 July 2011 and 31 December 2014. The Umbria drug prescription database and the regional archive of residents were used to gather information. Switching was defined as any transition between different epoetins (different substances and/or different products of the same substance) in a series of two prescriptions. The probability of switching was described in relationship to the duration of treatment in a survival analysis.
Overall, 3258 subjects received prescriptions of epoetins. Among the 2896 patients with at least two prescriptions, 354 (12.2%) experienced one or more switches. The probability of switching depended on the duration of treatment: approximately 15% of users switched within 12 months of observation and 25% switched within 2 years. Switching was not limited to reference and biosimilar epoetins and it affected patent and off-patent epoetins equally.
Switching between different epoetins was related to the duration of use and most episodes of switching involved epoetins that have never been contrasted in a comparability exercise. The present level of switching may provide reassurance to physicians when taken together with other sources of comparative evidence.

Title: ECCO position statement: the use of biosimilar medicines in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Publication Date: 2013-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23623738
Abstract: Biologics have become key agents for the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biosimilars are biological medicines similar to previously authorized biologics and are already available in some countries. This ECCO Position Statement defines the collective view of European specialist in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) concerning biosimilars. Biosimilars are not comparable to generic small molecules, since both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that can have profound effects on clinical efficacy and immunogenicity. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials in IBD, post-marketing pharmacoviligance, and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar should be requirements before approval. Switching from an established biologic to a biosimilar to save costs is likely to be as inappropriate and inefecctive as switching between current biologics that act on the same target, except when there is loss of response.

Title: GP2015: An Etanercept Biosimilar.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28940172
Abstract: GP2015 is the second biosimilar of the reference p75 TNF receptor-Fc fusion protein etanercept. It is approved for use in all indications for which reference etanercept is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis. GP2015 has similar physiochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference etanercept, and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in healthy volunteers. GP2015 demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to that of reference etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; the tolerability, safety and immunogenicity profiles of the two agents were also generally similar. Switching between GP2015 and reference etanercept had no impact on clinical efficacy, tolerability or immunogenicity. The role of reference etanercept in the management of inflammatory autoimmune conditions is well established and GP2015 provides an effective biosimilar alternative for patients requiring etanercept therapy.

Title: Biosimilar medicines - Review.
Publication Date: 2016-Mar-16
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27176756
Abstract: By definition, biosimilars are similar to a biological reference that has already received marketing authorization for biologic drugs.The purpose of biosimilars is reducing costs, thus increasing access to this treatment, however, the concerns of health professionals and users refer to the fact that to reduce costs will not neglecting the quality, effectiveness and especially security.
The aim of this study is then to assess the degree of similarity between the biosimilar and its reference biopharmaceuticals, trying to understand the production process, requirements necessary for approval, and its impact on the quality, safety, efficacy and costs.
For the systematic review without meta-analysis, we researched articles to the b-on, Pubmed and Medscape to 2005-2014, and selected 23 articles that contributed to the verification of the objectives of this study.
Several studies indicate that overall the biosimilar and biological reference showed no significant differences except those inherent to the production process, being the first susceptible to comparability tests demonstrating the similarity in terms of clinical efficacy and safety.
Biosimilars will be increasingly present in the future as promising therapeutic arsenal and targeted therapy, however, issues related to immunogenicity, interchangeability, automatic substitution and extrapolation of indications should continue to be studied and debated.

Title: Safety, efficacy and drug survival of biologics and biosimilars for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2018-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29094341
Abstract: Real-life data on newer biological and biosimilar agents for moderate-to-severe psoriasis are lacking.
To examine safety, efficacy and time to discontinuation (drug survival) of biologics (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab) and compare originators with biosimilars (i.e. Enbrel with Benepali, and Remicade with Remsima).
The DERMBIO registry contains data on all Danish patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with biologics. We examined patients treated between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2017. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression to examine drug survival patterns.
A total of 3495 treatment series (2161 patients) were included (adalimumab n = 1332; etanercept n = 579; infliximab n = 333; ustekinumab n = 1055 and secukinumab n = 196). Secukinumab had the highest number of PASI 100 (100% improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) respondents, but also the lowest drug survival among all the biologics. Ustekinumab had the highest drug survival overall. There were no significant differences in discontinuation risk between originator and biosimilar versions of infliximab or etanercept. Treatment with higher than approved dosages was frequent for all drugs except for adalimumab and secukinumab. Adverse events (predominantly infections) were most frequent for secukinumab compared with the other agents.
Ustekinumab was associated with the highest drug survival, and secukinumab with the lowest, although most patients on secukinumab were non-naïve. Switching from originator to biosimilar had no significant impact on drug survival, and the safety profiles were comparable. Adverse events occurred most frequently with secukinumab. Future studies are warranted to assess the long-term safety of novel biologics for psoriasis.

Title: Quantification of active infliximab in human serum with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a tumor necrosis factor alpha -based pre-analytical sample purification and a stable isotopic labeled infliximab bio-similar as internal standard: A target-based, sensitive and cost-effective method.
Publication Date: 2016-Jul-08
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27264745
Abstract: The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Infliximab (IFX) is a widely used drug for the treatment of several inflammatory autoimmune diseases. However, approximately 10% of patients develop anti-infliximab antibodies (ATIs) rendering the treatment ineffective. Early detection of underexposure to unbound IFX would result in a timely switch of therapy which could aid in the treatment of this disease. Streptavidin coated 96 well plates were used to capture biotinylated-tumor necrosis factor -alpha (b-TNF-α), which in turn was used to selectively extract the active form of IFX in human serum. After elution, IFX was digested using trypsin and one signature peptide was selected for subsequent analysis on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The internal standard used was a stable isotopic labeled IFX bio-similar. The assay was successfully validated according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines and was found to be linear in a range of 0.5-20μg/mL (r(2)=0.994). Lower limit of quantification for the assay (<20% CV) was 0.5μg/mL, requiring only 2μL of sample. Cross-validation against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) resulted in a high correlation between methods (r(2)=0.95 with a ρc=0.83) and the accuracy was in line with previously published results. In conclusion, a sensitive, robust and cost-effective method was developed for the bio-analysis of IFX with LC-MS/MS by means of a target-based pre-analytical sample purification. Moreover, low volume and costs of consumables per sample promote its feasibility in (pre)clinical studies and in therapeutic drug monitoring. This method should be considered as first choice due to its accuracy and multiple degree of selectivity.

Title: Switching From Originator to Biosimilar Human Growth Hormone Using Dialogue Teamwork: Single-Center Experience From Sweden.
Publication Date: 2013-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24392303
Abstract: A new treatment plan was implemented at Skåne University Hospital, on economic grounds, for children requiring recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. This involved switching patients from treatment with originator rhGHs to treatment with a biosimilar rhGH, somatropin (Omnitrope<sup>®</sup>), using a Dialogue Teamwork approach. The feasibility of using this approach to implement the switch of treatment was assessed, as well as the impact of the switch on treatment efficacy and cost of therapy.
As part of the Dialogue Teamwork approach, patients/parents received several opportunities for dialogue and sources of information, including discussions with the Head of Department, the responsible physician and a specialized endocrinology nurse. Height and height standard deviation score (HSDS) data were plotted for each individual patient (<i>N</i> = 98). A modeling approach was also used, to predict growth after switching to biosimilar rhGH; the predictions were then compared to the actual observed height after the switch. Costs to the clinic of rhGH therapy were calculated between May-August 2009 and May-August 2012.
Of the 102 patients offered the switch, 98 accepted. Height and HSDS data indicated there was no negative impact on growth velocity after the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Modeling demonstrated that observed growth following the switch was consistent with predicted growth based on data before patients were switched. There were no reports of serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions following the switch to biosimilar rhGH. Following the switch, the cost to the clinic of rhGH treatment decreased from approximately 6 million SEK (May-August 2009) to approximately 4 million SEK (May-August 2012). This corresponds to an annual saving of 6 million SEK (€650,000).
Patients were successfully switched from originator to biosimilar rhGH (somatropin), with no negative impact on growth, and no serious or unexpected adverse drug reactions. The switch from originator to biosimilar rhGH is associated with substantial cost savings.

Title: Patients' information and perspectives on biosimilars in rheumatology: A French nation-wide survey.
Publication Date: 2019-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30659920
Abstract: To assess the patients' information about biosimilars and to identify the patients' incentives and deterrents to concur with the use of biosimilars.
Nation-wide cross-sectional study assessing information and concerns about biosimilars of French patients treated for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, whether they were treated or not by a biological DMARD. The assessment was available online from March to July 2017.
Among the 629 respondents, 43% knew what biosimilars were. The main sources of information were rheumatologists and patient associations. Among patients treated with a biosimilar, 44% were not informed before they received the treatment. The patients' concerns focused on the non-similar molecular structure (46%), efficacy (60%) and safety (57%) comparatively to the originator biologic. 15% of respondents would refuse to switch their biologic to its biosimilar. More than 50% of respondents would warily accept to switch medications and interrupt the treatment if in doubt. Being informed about biosimilars and a good understanding of the definition of biosimilars were characteristics associated with better adherence to biosimilars. The rheumatologist was considered the most influent source of information about biosimilars and was considered reliable when deciding to switch a biologic to its biosimilar. Patient were reluctant to substitution of the medications by pharmacists (2%). Medico-economical issues acted as an incentive and a deterrent to accept the switch of medication.
Biosimilars are largely unknown to patients. Information seems to be instrumental in improving the patients' adherence to biosimilars and could help preserving the therapeutic relationship and avoiding a nocebo effect.

Title: The evolving role of biosimilars in haematology-oncology: a practical perspective.
Publication Date: 2015-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622996
Abstract: The loss of patents covering many biopharmaceutical/biological agents in the mid 1990s led to the introduction of a new generation of drugs: biosimilars. These new agents, produced by living cells just as the originator drugs, are chemically highly similar to endogenous human proteins; characterized by three-dimensionally complex, high molecular weight compounds. Among the first biosimilars used in haematology-oncology were erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After five years of use in clinical practice, the efficacy and safety profile of biosimilars approved by the European Medicines Agency is excellent. Over the next year or two, biosimilar monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) will become available; the first will be rituximab and trastuzumab. Not only are MoAbs more complex in terms of molecular weight and number of amino acids than the first biosimilars, but they are also anticancer drugs, not merely supportive treatments like their predecessors. This opens up important questions. How are regulatory agencies to assess their clinical efficacy, immunogenicity and safety? Is the neoadjuvant clinical setting the best to evaluate them? What will regulatory agencies decide in terms of switching an originator molecule for a biosimilar or extrapolating efficacy results from one pathology to another? Once biosimilars of rituximab and trastuzumab are approved, several challenging issues will need to be addressed such as how to maintain appropriate pharmacovigilance, how to extrapolate across indications, and issues concerning automatic substitution. There is currently no consensus in any of these areas. This review addresses all these issues: new challenges that the oncology community will face in the near future.

Title: Multiple switches between GP2015, an etanercept biosimilar, with originator product do not impact efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis: 30-week results from the phase 3, confirmatory EGALITY study.
Publication Date: 2018-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28960486
Abstract: EGALITY was a phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study conducted in patients with plaque-type psoriasis as a part of totality of evidence gathered during the development of GP2015, an etanercept biosimilar.
To demonstrate equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and the etanercept originator product (ETN, Enbrel<sup>®</sup> ) and evaluate effects of repeated switching between GP2015 and ETN. Results for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity during treatment period (TP) 2 (TP2) are presented pooling the two continued treatment arms (pooled continued) versus the two treatment arms with repeated switches (pooled switched).
Patients (n = 531) were randomized 1:1 to self-administer GP2015 or ETN twice-weekly subcutaneously during TP1. Patients with a ≥50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were re-randomized for TP2 to continue the same treatment at once-weekly dosing or to undergo three consecutive treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Patients continued the last-assigned treatment during TP2, until week 52.
Mean (standard deviation [SD]) PASI scores at baseline were similar in patients who underwent multiple switches compared to those with continued treatments during TP2. During TP2, PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 response rates, percent change from baseline in PASI scores and all other efficacy parameters were similar between the pooled switched and pooled continued treatment groups at all time points. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events including injection site reactions was comparable between the pooled switched (36.7%) and pooled continued (34.9%) groups. None of the patients in either treatment group were positive for binding anti-drug antibodies in TP2.
Treatment efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were similar between the pooled continued and pooled switched treatments during TP2, indicating that there are no effects in the short term on clinical data of multiple switches between GP2015 and ETN.

Title: The EGALITY study: a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of GP2015, a proposed etanercept biosimilar, vs. the originator product in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
Publication Date: 2017-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27787890
Abstract: GP2015 is a proposed etanercept biosimilar.
To demonstrate equivalent efficacy, and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and the etanercept originator (ETN, Enbrel<sup>®</sup> ) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
In total, 531 eligible patients were randomized 1 : 1 to self-administer GP2015 or ETN twice weekly subcutaneously. Patients with ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were rerandomized to continue the same treatment on a once-weekly dosing schedule or to undergo a sequence of three treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30. Thereafter, patients continued treatment with the product they had been assigned to last, up to week 52.
The difference in PASI 75 (75% improvement from baseline PASI score) response rates at week 12 between GP2015 and ETN (primary end point) was -2·3%. The 95% confidence interval (-9·85 to 5·30) was well contained within the prespecified margin range of -18 to 18. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events up to week 52 was comparable between continued GP2015 (59·8%) and ETN (57·3%); switching treatments revealed comparable safety profiles. Antidrug antibodies, all non-neutralizing, were limited to five patients on ETN during treatment period 1, and one patient in the switched ETN group, who had been treated with GP2015 for 12 weeks at the time of the finding.
The EGALITY study demonstrated equivalent efficacy and comparable safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and ETN. The study results provide the final clinical confirmation of biosimilarity and contribute to the totality of the evidence proposing that GP2015 is an etanercept biosimilar.

Title: Loss of efficacy and safety of the switch from infliximab original to infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-14
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30581277
Abstract: Infliximab original has changed the natural history of inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBD) over the past two decades. However, the recent expiration of its patent has allowed the entry of the first Infliximab biosimilar into the European and Spanish markets. Currently switching drugs data in IBD are limited.
To compare the efficacy of infliximab biosimilar, CT-P13, against infliximab original, analyzing the loss of response of both at the 12 mo follow-up in patients with IBD.
An observational study of two cohorts has been conducted. One retrospective cohort that included patients with IBD treated with Infliximab original, and a prospective cohort of patients who were switching from infliximab original to infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13). We had analyzed the overall efficacy and loss of efficacy in patients in remission at the end of one year after treatment with the original drug compared to the results of the year of treatment with the biosimilar.
98 patients (CD 67, CU 31) were included in both cohorts. The overall efficacy for infliximab original per year of treatment was 71% <i>vs</i> 68.2% for infliximab biosimilar (<i>P</i> = 0.80). The loss of overall efficacy at 12 mo for infliximab original was 6.6% <i>vs</i> 14.5% for infliximab biosimilar (<i>P</i> = 0.806). The loss of efficacy in patients who were in basal remission was 16.3% for infliximab original <i>vs</i> 27.1% for infliximab biosimilar. Adverse events were 9.2% for infliximab original <i>vs</i> 11.2% for infliximab biosimilar.
The overall efficacy and loss of treatment response with infliximab biosimilar (CT-P13) is similar to that observed with infliximab original in patients who were switching at the 12 mo follow-up. There is no difference in the rate of adverse events.

Title: Long-term follow up after switching from original infliximab to an infliximab biosimilar: real-world data.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31258621
Abstract: Several studies have reported positive efficacy outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with CT-P13, an infliximab biosimilar. Data from follow-up periods longer than 1 year are still scarce. Here, we assessed the long-term efficacy data, loss of response and safety after switching from infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
This was a prospective single-center observational study involving patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis switched from infliximab to CT-P13 treatment and reviewed up to 24 months. Efficacy and loss of response were measured using the Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) index and partial Mayo score for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. C-reactive protein, infliximab drug levels, adverse events and antidrug antibodies were also monitored throughout the study.
A total of 64 patients with Crohn's disease and 36 patients with ulcerative colitis were included. Most of them (72%) remained on CT-P13. Overall, 28% of patients discontinued the therapy due to loss of response, adverse events or long-lasting clinical remission. Remission at 18 and 24 months occurred in 69.9% and 68.5% of patients, respectively. Dose increase was performed in 22% of patients, with remission being reached in 60% of them. HB index, partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein and infliximab drug levels did not show significant changes. Serious adverse events were reported in 14% of patients. Overall, two patients developed low levels of antidrug antibodies.
Most of the patients switching from original infliximab were maintained on CT-P13 at 2 years of follow up with a good profile of efficacy and safety.

Title: Switching from reference infliximab to CT-P13 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: results of a multicenter study after 12 months.
Publication Date: 2018-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893581
Abstract: infliximab has changed the natural history of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). The advent of biosimilar treatments such as CT-P13 will hopefully improve the availability of biological therapies. Data with regard to drug switching are currently limited. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of switching from the reference product (RP), infliximab, to CT-P13 in patients with IBD.
this was a multicenter prospective observational study in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). All patients had switched from infliximab RP (Remicade®) to CT-P13 treatment and were followed up for 12 months. The efficacy endpoint was the change in clinical remission assessed at 0 and 12 months, according to the Harvey-Bradshaw score and partial Mayo score for patients with CD and UC, respectively. Adverse events were monitored and recorded throughout the study.
a total of 167 patients (116 CD/51 UC) were included; 88.8% (103/116) of patients with CD were in remission at the time of the drug switch and 69.7% were in remission at 12 months. The Harvey-Bradshaw (HB) score significantly changed at 12 months (p = 0.001); 84.3% (43/51) of patients with UC were in remission at the time of the drug switch and 76.7% were in remission at 12 months. No significant changes in the median partial Mayo score (p = 0.87) were observed at 12 months. Serious adverse events related to medication were reported in 12/167 (7.2%) cases.
switching from infliximab RP to CT-P13 is safe and effective at 12 months. The loss of efficacy at 12 months was 15.7%.

Title: Clinical and Regulatory Concerns of Biosimilars: A Review of Literature.
Publication Date: 2020-Aug-11
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32796549
Abstract: Although biosimilars have been part of clinical practice for more than a decade, healthcare professionals (HCPs) do not fully accept them. This is because of the perception that biosimilars may not be like their originators in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. This study aims to evaluate the current knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals toward biosimilar prescription, and to elaborate on their concerns. We reviewed the literature using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct electronic databases in the period from 2018 to 2020. The knowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals vary between countries, between clinical profiles and between studies. Although most of the healthcare professionals had a positive attitude to prescribing biosimilars, they would still prefer to prescribe them in initial treatment. Generally, HCPs were against multiple switches and substitution of biosimilars at the pharmacy level. HCP's key concern was interchangeability, with eventual consequences on the clinical outcome of patients. HCPs still approach biosimilars with caution and stigma. HCPs need to have an unbiased coherent understanding of biosimilars at clinical, molecular and regulatory levels. It was also observed that most of their concerns are more theoretical than science-based. Physicians are in an excellent position to accept biosimilars, but they need the additional support of regulatory authorities to approve and take into consideration the available scientific data regarding biosimilars.

Title: Rapid and Sustained Improvement in a Patient With Plaque Psoriasis Switched to Brodalumab After Failing Treatment Clearance on Six Other Biologic Therapies.
Publication Date: 2020-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023014
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, remitting/relapsing autoimmune condition involving a dysregulated inflammatory response of the interleukin (IL) 23/T-helper (Th)-17 pathway. Greater understanding of the immune-mediated pathology of the disease has led to the development of numerous biological therapies and biosimilars that target the various inflammatory pathways. Each biologic has a unique mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics resulting in different clinical efficacy and tolerability. This case describes a 64-year-old female with a nine-year history of plaque psoriasis, predominantly affecting her feet, who was successfully treated with brodalumab having previously failed multiple topical and systemic therapies including six other biologicals. To date, there are few guidelines to help physicians select the optimal biology agent and none that have looked specifically at plantar psoriasis. For this patient, finding a biologic that worked and was tolerable was a process of trial and error that took four years. The results achieved in this previously refractory patient with difficult-to-treat psoriasis may be due to the unique mechanism of action of brodalumab, though this will need to be confirmed in larger studies.

Title: Biosimilar insulins: guidance for data interpretation by clinicians and users.
Publication Date: 2015-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25974131
Abstract: Biosimilar insulins are approved copies of insulins outside patent protection. Advantages may include greater market competition and potential cost reduction, but clinicians and users lack a clear perspective on 'biosimilarity' for insulins. The manufacturing processes for biosimilar insulins are manufacturer-specific and, although these are reviewed by regulators there are few public data available to allow independent assessment or review of issues such as intrinsic quality or batch-to-batch variation. Preclinical measures used to assess biosimilarity, such as tissue and cellular studies of metabolic activity, physico-chemical stability and animal studies of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity may be insufficiently sensitive to differences, and are often not formally published. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (glucose clamps) with humans, although core assessments, have problems of precision which are relevant for accurate insulin dosing. Studies that assess clinical efficacy and safety and device compatibility are limited by current outcome measures, such as glycated haemoblobin levels and hypoglycaemia, which are insensitive to differences between insulins. To address these issues, we suggest that all comparative data are put in the public domain, and that systematic clinical studies are performed to address batch-to-batch variability, delivery devices, interchangeability in practice and long-term efficacy and safety. Despite these challenges biosimilar insulins are a welcome addition to diabetes therapy and, with a transparent approach, should provide useful benefit to insulin users.

Title: Biosimilars in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Publication Date: 2014-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24722561
Abstract: A biosimilar is a copy of an approved biological medicine whose patent protections have expired. Biosimilars of antibodies to tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) are becoming important in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The first one introduced commercially is an infliximab biosimilar. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of anti-TNFα biosimilars. The literature on biosimilars of monoclonal anti-TNFα antibodies was reviewed, including their manufacture and approval pathways, concerns about efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, extrapolation, switching and labelling. Previous experience with biosimilars of epoetin and other growth factors was also reviewed. The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody registered for the treatment of IBD. The major advantage of biosimilars is the reduced cost of therapy. Concerns have arisen, however, about the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 in IBD, the extrapolation of results from rheumatologic trials to IBD and the free interchangeability of CT-P13 with infliximab. Experience with simple peptide biosimilars, such as epoetins and growth factors, has generally been positive, with these biosimilars having similar efficacy and safety as the original products, although immunogenicity remains a major concern. Upcoming postregistration studies will address concerns on biosimilars in IBD, including their efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, switching and interchangeability. Biosimilars active against the same epitopes, but with improved pharmacokinetic properties that enhance their efficacy and/or safety, may be the next stage in the development of biosimilars. Anti-TNFα biosimilars represent promising new treatment options for patients with IBD. However, data on their efficacy and safety in IBD are needed.

Title: Switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab - real world data of a prospective 18 months follow-up of a single-centre IBD population.
Publication Date: 2018-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29852793
Abstract: Long-term data regarding switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 are sparse. Concerns about increased immunogenicity after switching have been raised. We aimed to study the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity after switching from originator infliximab to CT-P13 in a real-world IBD population with 18 months prospective follow-up.
All adult IBD patients treated with originator infliximab at the Department of Gastroenterology, Oslo University Hospital, were switched to CT-P13 and followed prospectively for 18 months. The primary endpoints were (i) the proportion of patients remaining on CT-P13 18 months after switching and (ii) immunogenicity during 18 months after switching. The secondary endpoints included (i) adverse events, (ii) changes in disease activity, C-reactive protein, anaemia, faecal calprotectin, infliximab dose and interval and p-infliximab.
In total, 143 IBD patients were switched, 99 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis. Altogether, 130 (91%) remained on CT-P13 throughout 18 months. Two patients developed ADAs at moderate level and discontinued CT-P13. Another 10 patients discontinued CT-P13 (two due to loss of response without ADAs, four due to adverse events, and four in remission and a personal wish to stop). There was no overall change in disease activity scores or in the other studied variables except for p-infliximab, which increased significantly.
The present study provides valuable evidence for the safety and effectiveness of switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab over a prolonged period of 18 months and demonstrates that switching was well tolerated and did not affect the long term clinical outcome.

Title: Switching from biosimilar (Basalin) to originator (Lantus) insulin glargine is effective in Chinese patients with diabetes mellitus: a retrospective chart review.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29862021
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of switching from Basalin® to Lantus® in Chinese patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). <b>Methods:</b>  A retrospective chart review conducted using the electronic medical records of patients hospitalized at the Qingdao Endocrine and Diabetes Hospital from 2005 to 2016. All patients were diagnosed with DM and underwent switching of insulin from Basalin to Lantus during hospitalization. Data collected included fasting (FBG), pre- and post-prandial whole blood glucose, insulin dose, reasons for insulin switching and hypoglycemia. Four study time points were defined as: hospital admission, Basalin initiation, insulin switching (date of final dose of Basalin), and hospital discharge. Blood glucose measurements were imputed as the values recorded closest to the dates of these four time points for each patient. <b>Results:</b> Data from 73 patients (70 patients with type 2 diabetes, 2 with type 1, and 1 undisclosed) were analyzed. At admission, mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and FBG were 8.9% (SD=1.75) and 9.98 (3.22) mmol/L, respectively. Between Basalin initiation and insulin switch, mean FBG decreased from 9.68 mmol/L to 8.03 mmol/L (p<0.0001), over a mean 10.8 (SD=6.85) days of Basalin treatment, and reduced further to 7.30 mmol/L at discharge (p=0.0116) following a mean 6.6 (7.36) days of Lantus. The final doses of Basalin and Lantus were similar (0.23 vs. 0.24 IU/kg/day; p=0.2409). Furthermore, reductions in pre- and post-prandial blood glucose were also observed between Basalin initiation, insulin switch and hospital discharge. The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was low during Basalin (2 [2.4%]) and Lantus (1 [1.2%]) treatment, with no cases of severe hypoglycemia. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this study population, switching from Basalin to Lantus was associated with further reductions in blood glucose, although the dose of insulin glargine did not increase. Further studies are required to verify these findings and determine the reason for this phenomenon.

Title: Adalimumab Biosimilars in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review of the Evidence for Biosimilarity.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33263165
Abstract: Although treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) has significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients do not have access to these treatments. As cost-effective alternatives to their reference products (RPs), biosimilars provide an opportunity to increase access to bDMARDs. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration have detailed pathways for the approval of biosimilars based on establishing the similarity of the biosimilar to the RP in terms of structure and function, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. A number of biosimilars of adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, and rituximab RPs have been approved in the United States and/or European Union. This article is focused on the seven adalimumab biosimilars. A review of the data for the biosimilars FKB327, ABP 501, BI 695501, GP2017, MSB11022, PF-06410293, and SB5 confirm that these products are highly similar to the adalimumab RP with regard to structure, physicochemical and biological properties, PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in the treatment of RA and other chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory conditions. Data from several switching studies showed no changes in efficacy, safety, trough serum drug concentration, or immunogenicity between the biosimilars and their RP.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02260791, NCT02405780, NCT01970475, NCT02137226, NCT02045979, NCT02744755, NCT02144714, NCT02167139, NCT03014947, NCT02114931, NCT02640612, NCT02167139, NCT03052322, NCT02480153.

Title: Infection, malignancy, switching, biosimilars, antibody formation, drug survival and withdrawal, and dose reduction: what have we learned over the last year about tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis?
Publication Date: 2016-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26927443
Abstract: This article reviews the most current studies investigating the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Studies over the past year have clarified that suppressing TNF with monoclonal antibodies does increase infection risk, yet coupled with reduction in disease activity and less use of corticosteroids as a consequence, the overall risk to the population is balanced. With caution (provided by some recent studies) TNFi agents can be reduced (dosage intervals lengthened) and maintain benefit. Biosimilars, not surprisingly, are going to be therapeutically identical to the innovator, and not more of a risk for causing antibodies to interfere with benefit. Uncertainty remains about when and how to make the switch.
TNFi agents have made their powerful impact on management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but questions remain: what is their true infection and malignancy risk in the evolving populations using these drugs today; are we able to maintain their benefit with a reduced schedule (and presumed less cost) and yet recapture their benefit if we guess wrong; are biosimilars just as good, or even better with less cost; are there data to inform us about how to achieve successful switching among different mechanism of action TNFi agents? Finally, are we going to face the specter of cost containment causing change from innovator to biosimilars over which we have no control?

Title: Biosimilars in ulcerative colitis: When and for who?
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30060937
Abstract: The introduction of biological agents has revolutionized the management of ulcerative colitis (UC). Biosimilars are considered to be equivalent to the reference biologic products in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, clinical effectiveness and safety and have now been approved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). CT-P13 was the first biosimilar to infliximab that obtained regulatory approval by the EMA and US FDA. Accumulating data on biosimilars led to an increased acceptance amongst practicing gastroenterologists and their use can be associated with a potential reduction in healthcare costs. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on biosimilar use in UC. Authors review the existing data on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of biosimilar infliximab and adalimumab agents. Emerging data suggests that switching from originator to biosimilar is safe for CT-P13 infliximab, however data on other biosimilars, multiple-switching, reverse-switching, or cross-switching between biosimilars is lacking. The pathway for interchangeability of biosimilars is different in the US and Europe and many aspects have yet to be clarified by federal regulators. Since the approval of the first biosimilar, the biosimilar concept seems to be successful and has led to an increased use of biosimilar drugs in the treatment of UC worldwide with a better access for patients to biologic. Real-world data from prospective observational studies for 'follow-on' biosimilars is needed to ensure that safety, efficacy and immunogenicity is comparable to the originator in IBD, and that switching from the originator or among biosimilars is a safe option.

Title: Safety of Biologics, Including Biosimilars: Perspectives on Current Status and Future Direction.
Publication Date: 2018-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29796832
Abstract: In recent years, marketing of highly innovative and costly biologics improved the management of high-burden diseases such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, and chronic renal failure. Several widely prescribed biologics have recently lost or will shortly lose their patents, thus opening avenues to the marketing of a growing number of biosimilars worldwide, which are products similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to already licensed reference products, thus allowing for potential savings in pharmaceutical expenditure. Numerous debates about the interchangeability between biosimilars and reference products are still ongoing, owing to concerns about potential immunogenicity raised by switching, which may cause a lack of effect and toxicity. Patients successfully treated with biologic therapy may theoretically receive biosimilars to contain costs, if reference product and related biosimilar are judged as interchangeable. However, the positions of regulatory agencies on the interchangeability and automatic substitution of biologics with biosimilars are very different. The benefit-risk profile of biosimilars has been often questioned by clinicians owing to the limited amount of pre-marketing information on clinical efficacy and safety, despite biosimilarity being based on a comparability exercise with the reference product to gain the biosimilar approval. Nevertheless, after more than 10 years of marketing from the first biosimilar approval in Europe, no proof of differences in terms of the safety profile of biosimilars and originators has been reported. In this context, post-marketing evaluation of both biologics and biosimilars safety profiles through analyses from spontaneous reporting databases and claims databases is crucial. An important issue for the pharmacovigilance of biologics concerns the traceability, indicating the brand name and batch number in spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, but this requirement is not frequently addressed. This review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics and potential challenges in the safety profile assessment of biologics with a focus on the post-marketing setting.

Title: Rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2019-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31498682
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by long-standing inflammation in multiple joints. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, which binds to CD20, is effective in suppressing disease activity and preventing joint damage in RA. CT-P10 was developed as a biosimilar of rituximab and approved for use to treat hematologic malignancies and immune diseases including RA. <b>Area covered</b>: This article describes the need for this biosimilar and summarizes the non-clinical studies verifying the physicochemical and biologic similarities and the clinical studies confirming the clinical similarity of CT-P10 to rituximab in patients with RA. <b>Expert opinion</b>: CT-P10 had been evaluated and proven the efficacy and safety in RA in Phase I and III randomized controlled trial with extension studies including a switching regimen. Therefore, CT-P10 is recommended in the treatment of RA.

Title: Review of safety and efficacy of approved systemic psoriasis therapies.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246393
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which affects nearly 3% of the adult US population. Due to the chronic nature of the disease and need for long-term treatment, psoriasis is associated with substantial disease burden and negative impact on patients' quality of life. In the past, systemic agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin have been the mainstay treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. Multiple new molecular targets have been recently identified, and novel biologic therapies directed at these targets have been approved leading to a paradigm shift in psoriasis management. However, despite the availability of several treatment options and continued introduction of highly efficacious biologics, undertreatment of psoriasis patients remains a huge problem. This can be largely attributed to several causes including high cost of biologics, lack of experience, and reluctance of practitioners to initiate or switch to systemic treatment regimens in moderate to severe psoriasis patients. In this article, we aim to provide a concise review of mechanism, safety, and efficacy of the approved systemic treatments for psoriasis.

Title: Descriptive Analysis of Long- and Intermediate-Acting Insulin and Key Safety Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
Publication Date: 2019-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31405345
Abstract: As new biosimilar and follow-on insulins enter the market, more data are needed on safety, effectiveness, and patterns of use for these products to inform prescriber and patient decision-making regarding treatment. Additionally, data are needed regarding real-world patterns of use to inform future studies comparing the safety and effectiveness of bio-similars to already approved agents for diabetes treatment.
To analyze the medication use patterns, adverse events, and availability of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) values for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who use long-acting insulin (LAI) or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), an intermediate-acting insulin.
We used the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's (BBCIC) distributed research network (DRN) for this descriptive analysis. The analysis time frame was January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015, and included patients continuously insured for at least 183 days before the first date of a filled prescription for LAI or NPH insulin alone or with rapid- or short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, whether newly starting insulin or switching to a different product. Insulin exposure episodes were the unit of analysis, and patients were classified in cohorts according to treatment. We followed patients until end of health plan enrollment or the end of the study period. We used occurrence of a study outcome, switch to another medication regimen, discontinuation of the current medication, or study end date to mark the end of an insulin episode. We describe demographics and availability of A1c values for analysis. Study outcomes included severe hypoglycemic events and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).
We identified 103,951 patients with T2DM from a database of 39.1 million patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage pharmacy and medical benefits, who contributed 279,533 unique insulin exposure episodes. Most episodes (89%) included patients using LAI, and 52% of patients contributed data to 2 or more exposure cohorts. Insulin episodes lasted an average of 3.5 months, and patients had an average follow-up of 8.6 months. The unadjusted rate of severe hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention was 96.9 per 10,000 patient-years at risk (10kPYR). The unadjusted incident MACE rate was 676.9 events per 10kPYR. 38,330 T2DM patients in the BBCIC DRN had a baseline A1c available, and of those, less than 50% had a follow-up A1c result.
Among patients with T2DM, our observed insulin patterns of use and rates of severe hypoglycemic outcomes and MACE are consistent with other studies. We noted a paucity of A1c results available, which implies that additional data sources may be needed to augment the BBCIC DRN.
This study was coordinated and funded by the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and represents the independent findings of the BBCIC Insulins Principal Investigator and the BBCIC Insulins Research Team.

Title: Efficacy of pharmacological treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature research informing the 2019 update of the EULAR recommendations for management of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033937
Abstract: To inform the 2019 update of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
A systematic literature research (SLR) to investigate the efficacy of any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD, biological (b) and biosimilar DMARD, targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD) or glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in patients with RA was done by searching MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2016 and 8 March 2019.
234 abstracts were selected for detailed assessment, with 136 finally included. They comprised the efficacy of bDMARDs versus placebo or other bDMARDs, efficacy of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) across different patient populations and head-to-head of different bDMARDs versus JAKi or other bDMARDs. Switching of bDMARDs to other bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, strategic trials and tapering studies of bDMARDs, csDMARDs and JAKi were assessed. The drugs evaluated included abatacept, adalimumab, ABT-122, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, SBI-087, CNTO6785, decernotinib, etanercept, filgotinib, golimumab, GCs, GS-9876, guselkumab, hydroxychloroquine, infliximab, leflunomide, mavrilimumab, methotrexate, olokizumab, otilimab, peficitinib, rituximab, sarilumab, salazopyrine, secukinumab, sirukumab, tacrolimus, tocilizumab, tofacitinib, tregalizumab, upadacitinib, ustekinumab and vobarilizumab. The efficacy of many bDMARDs and tsDMARDs was shown. Switching to another tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or non-TNFi bDMARDs after TNFi treatment failure is efficacious. Tapering of DMARDs is possible in patients achieving long-standing stringent clinical remission; in patients with residual disease activity (including patients in LDA) the risk of flares is increased during the tapering. Biosimilars are non-inferior to their reference products.
This SLR informed the task force regarding the evidence base of various therapeutic regimen for the development of the update of EULAR's RA management recommendation.

Title: Retention Rate and Safety of Biosimilar CT-P13 in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Data from the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry.
Publication Date: 2020-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31734899
Abstract: The aim was to evaluate long-term drug retention, discontinuation, efficacy and safety of CT-P13 and reference infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) enrolled in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics (KOBIO) registry.
Patients included adults with RA who received CT-P13 or reference infliximab between December 2012 and December 2017. Drug retention, efficacy (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]-erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or DAS28-C-reactive protein [CRP] and American College of Rheumatology [ACR] core set measure), and adverse events (AEs) were assessed over 4-years' follow-up.
Data from 199 RA patients (CT-P13: n = 147; reference infliximab: n = 52) were analyzed. Median treatment duration was 1.22 years for CT-P13 and 1.40 years for reference infliximab (p = 0.67). Overall, 82% of patients received first-line therapy. Drug retention of CT-P13 versus reference infliximab was comparable for the overall population (p = 0.84) and for first-line (p = 0.66) and subsequent treatment lines (p = 0.96). Treatment changes or discontinuations occurred in 65.2% of patients with CT-P13 and 69.6% with reference infliximab. The most common reason for treatment changes or discontinuing treatment was lack of efficacy (CT-P13: 31.9%; reference infliximab: 34.8%). CT-P13 demonstrated comparable improvements in DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and ACR responses to reference infliximab. Overall, 19 grade 3 AEs were reported for CT-P13 and eight for reference infliximab.
Long-term data from patients with RA treated in routine clinical practice in Korea showed that CT-P13 had a comparable drug retention rate to reference infliximab, with similar efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. CLINICALTRIALS.

Title: Cardiac Safety of the Trastuzumab Biosimilar ABP 980 in Women with HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer in the Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled LILAC Study.
Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927716
Abstract: Although the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) blocker trastuzumab is generally well tolerated, cardiotoxicity can be an important therapeutic limitation.
In this prespecified analysis, we compared the cardiac safety of the trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 (KANJINTI™) and the trastuzumab reference product (RP; Herceptin<sup>®</sup>) in the phase III LILAC study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01901146).
In the neoadjuvant phase of LILAC, after run-in chemotherapy, 725 patients were randomized 1:1 to ABP 980 (n = 364) or trastuzumab RP (n = 361) plus paclitaxel (every 3 weeks [Q3W] or every week [QW]) for four cycles. After surgery, patients continued treatment Q3W for up to 1 year; ABP 980-treated patients continued ABP 980 (ABP 980/ABP 980; n = 364), and trastuzumab RP-treated patients either continued on the RP (trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP; n = 190) or switched to ABP 980 (trastuzumab RP/ABP 980; n = 171). Cardiac safety was monitored by computerized 12-lead electrocardiogram, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram. LVEF decline was defined as LVEF value decrease from study baseline by ≥ 10 percentage points and to < 50%.
Over the entire study, 22 (3.1%) patients had protocol-defined LVEF decline; no meaningful between-group differences were observed (ABP 980/ABP 980: 2.8%; trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP: 3.3%; trastuzumab RP/ABP 980: 3.5%). The incidence of cardiac adverse events was low and comparable in the treatment groups. One grade 3 cardiac failure event reported in the trastuzumab RP/ABP 980 arm, and another in the trastuzumab RP/trastuzumab RP arm, were coincident with LVEF decline. One patient discontinued the investigational product during the adjuvant phase because of cardiac failure.
These prespecified analyses confirm the tolerability of ABP 980 and demonstrate clinical similarity of ABP 980 and trastuzumab RP with respect to cardiac safety. No new cardiac safety signals were observed whether patients were receiving ABP 980 or switched from the RP to ABP 980.

Title: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Crohn´s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis): Cost of Treatment in Serbia and the Implications.
Publication Date: 2017-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27587010
Abstract: Although the costs of treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in developed countries are well established, they remain largely unknown in countries with recent histories of socio-economic transition including Serbia.
To estimate the costs of treatment including the resources used by patients with IBD in Serbia from a societal perspective. This includes both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
This cost-of-illness study was conducted to identify direct, indirect and out-of-pocket costs of treating patients with IBD in Serbia. Patients with IBD (n = 112) completed a semi-structured questionnaire with data concerning their utilisation of heath-care resources and illness-related expenditures. All costs were calculated in Republic of Serbia dinars (RSD) at a 1-year level (2014) and subsequently converted to Euros. Median values and ranges were reported to avoid potential distortions associated with mean costs.
Median total direct costs and total indirect costs per patient per year in patients with Crohn's disease were 192,614.32RSD (€1602.97) and 28,014.00RSD (€233.13) and 142,267.15RSD (€1183.97) and 21,436.00RSD (€178.39), respectively, in patients with ulcerative colitis. In both groups, the greatest component of direct costs was hospitalisation.
Costs of IBD in Serbia are lower than in more developed countries for two reasons. These include the fact that expensive biological therapy is currently under-utilised in Serbia and prices of health services are largely controlled by the State at a low level. The under-utilisation of biologicals may change with the advent of biosimilars at increasingly lower prices.

Title: [Practical aspects in the use of biosimilar insulins].
Publication Date: 2016-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27750344
Abstract: Following the market authorization of the first insulin biosimilar in 2014, further approvals are to be expected due to patent expiry of several originator insulins. Knowledge of the manufacturing and the characteristics of these pharmaceutical products is important for their rationale and safe use by the physician, the pharmacist and the patient.Biosimilars are not generics, but similar or comparable, yet not identical versions of the originator biopharmaceutical. Marketing authorization in the EU is granted only after passing a stringent procedure. So far, there is no evidence of problems specifically associated with insulin biosimilars. However, shifting a patient from an originator insulin to a biosimilar (or vice versa) should be done with care and under close monitoring. Automatic substitution of biosimilars in the pharmacy is not permitted in Germany. Administration devices also have a significant impact on safe use.

Title: Nocebos in rheumatology: emerging concepts and their implications for clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361674
Abstract: Nocebo effects are noxious reactions to therapeutic interventions that occur because of negative expectations of the patient. In the past decade, neurobiological data have revealed specific neural pathways induced by nocebos (that is, interventions that cause nocebo effects), as well as the associated mechanisms and predisposing factors of nocebo effects. Epidemiological data suggest that nocebos can have a notable effect on medication adherence, clinical outcomes and health-care policy. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) indicate that withdrawal of treatment by placebo-arm participants owing to adverse events is common; a proportion of these events could be nocebo effects. Moreover, in large-scale, open-label studies of patients with RMDs who transition from bio-originator to biosimilar therapeutics, biosimilar retention rates were much lower than in previous double-blind switch RCTs. This discrepancy suggests that in addition to the lack of response in some patients because of intrinsic differences between the drugs, nocebos might have an important role in low biosimilar retention, thus increasing the need for awareness and early identification of nocebo effects by rheumatologists and allied health-care professionals.

Publication Date: 2020-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32836292
Abstract: The concept of biosimilar medicine was launched by 2001 and 2004 European Directives. First European marketing authorizations were delivered in 2006. They are "copies" of biologically manufactured medicines, mostly proteins. Taking into account the intrinsic variability related to the biological manufacture process, some variation of the chemical structure of the finished compound may be observed. They impact especially the glycosylation residues but not the amino-acid sequence (for proteins). For this reason, the marketing authorization application dossier has to involve, as opposed to the generic medicine procedure, the demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence in at least one clinical indication of the princeps medicine. Introduction of biosimilar medicines of monoclonal antibodies has represented a remarkable event in the domain of rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology with infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab biosimilars and in cancerology domains with rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab biosimilars. Biosimilar medicines availability reduces the risk of drug supply rupture of princeps but their main impact is the economic one allowing cost reduction of costly princeps biological medicines. With the acquired clinical experience, the initial fears concerning switch form princeps to a biosimilar for a given patient has progressively disappeared.

Title: Budget Impact of Switching to Biosimilar Trastuzumab (CT-P6) for the Treatment of Breast Cancer and Gastric Cancer in 28 European Countries.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31201616
Abstract: As the economic burden of treating cancer patients has been soaring in European countries, performing a budget impact analysis is becoming one of the requirements for payers' application dossiers.
The objective of this study was to estimate the budgetary impact of introducing the biosimilar trastuzumab (CT-P6) from the payer's perspective and to determine the number of additional patients who could be treated with resulting savings in 28 European countries.
A budget impact model was developed to analyze the financial impact of switching from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in the treatment of early and metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer with a time horizon of 1-5 years. Budgetary savings and the number of patients potentially affected were measured based on epidemiological and sales volume data. The base-case analysis assumed that the price of CT-P6 is 70% of the originator price, the switching rate of originator to CT-P6 in the first year is 20%, and the annual growth in the switching rate for each subsequent year is 5%.
For analyses using the base-case scenario following CT-P6 introduction, the total estimated budgetary savings over a 5-year period (depending on the scenario) ranged from €1.13 billion to €2.27 billion based on epidemiological data, or from €0.91 billion to €1.82 billion based on sales volume data. In the first year only, the projected budgetary savings ranged from €58 million to €136 million, and the number of additional patients who could be treated using the savings ranged from 3503 to 7078 by sensitivity analysis.
The conducted budget impact analysis assessing a switch from originator trastuzumab to biosimilar CT-P6 in 28 European countries indicates that budget savings could be between €0.91 billion and €2.27 billion over the next 5 years. These savings could be used to help improve patient access to local biologics in their respective countries while simultaneously strengthening the overall public health landscape across the European Union.

Title: Economic Impact of Non-Medical Switching from Originator Biologics to Biosimilars: A Systematic Literature Review.
Publication Date: 2019-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31168766
Abstract: A systematic literature review was conducted to review and summarize the economic impact of non-medical switching (NMS) from biologic originators to their biosimilars (i.e., switching a patient's medication for reasons irrelevant to the patient's health).
English publications reporting healthcare resource utilization (HRU) or costs associated with biosimilar NMS were searched in PubMed and EMBASE over the past 10 years and from selected scientific conferences over the past 3 years, along with gray literature for all biologics with an approved biosimilar (e.g., tumor-necrosis factor inhibitors, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, insulin and hormone therapies).
A total of 1311 publications were retrieved, where 54 studies met the selection criteria. Seventeen studies reported increased real-world HRU or costs related to biosimilar NMS, e.g., higher rates of surgery (11%), steroid use (13%) and biosimilar dose escalating (6-35.4%). Among the studies that the estimated cost impact associated with NMS, 33 reported drug costs reduction, 12 reported healthcare costs post-NMS without a detailed breakdown, and 5 reported NMS setup and managing costs. Cost estimation/simulation studies demonstrated the cost reduction associated with NMS. However, variation across studies was substantial because of heterogeneity in study designs and assumptions (e.g., disease areas, scenarios of drug price discount rates, cost components, population size, study period, etc.).
Real-world studies reporting the economic impact of biosimilar NMS separately from drug costs are emerging, and those that reported such results found increased HRU in patients with biosimilar NMS. Studies of cost estimation have been largely limited to drug prices. Comprehensive evaluation of the economic impact of NMS should incorporate all important elements of healthcare service needs such as drug price, biologic rebates, HRU, NMS program setup, administration and monitoring costs.

Title: Comprehensive manipulation of glycosylation profiles across development scales.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30252592
Abstract: The extent and pattern of glycosylation on therapeutic antibodies can influence their circulatory half-life, engagement of effector functions, and immunogenicity, with direct consequences to efficacy and patient safety. Hence, controlling glycosylation patterns is central to any drug development program, yet poses a formidable challenge to the bio-manufacturing industry. Process changes, which can affect glycosylation patterns, range from manufacturing at different scales or sites, to switching production process mode, all the way to using alternative host cell lines. In the emerging space of biosimilars development, often times all of these aspects apply. Gaining a deep understanding of the direction and extent to which glycosylation quality attributes can be modulated is key for efficient fine-tuning of glycan profiles in a stage appropriate manner, but establishment of such platform knowledge is time consuming and resource intensive. Here we report an inexpensive and highly adaptable screening system for comprehensive modulation of glycans on antibodies expressed in CHO cells. We characterize 10 media additives in univariable studies and in combination, using a design of experiments approach to map the design space for tuning glycosylation profile attributes. We introduce a robust workflow that does not require automation, yet enables rapid process optimization. We demonstrate scalability across deep wells, shake flasks, AMBR-15 cell culture system, and 2 L single-use bioreactors. Further, we show that it is broadly applicable to different molecules and host cell lineages. This universal approach permits fine-tuned modulation of glycan product quality, reduces development costs, and enables agile implementation of process changes throughout the product lifecycle.

Title: Safety and efficacy of switching from infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 to infliximab biosimilar SB2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33369956
Abstract: For patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, switching from infliximab originator to biosimilars is effective and safe. Few data on single switch have been published, and data on multiple switches of different infliximab are unavailable.
A retrospective analysis of patients who switched from CT-P13 to SB2, and of those with multiple switches among different infliximab compounds was conducted. Clinical activity, C reactive protein (CRP), adverse events (AE) and loss of response (LOR) were recorded.
Thirty-six patients (26 males, 14 Crohn's disease and 22 ulcerative colitis) were enrolled and followed up for >6 months. All patients switched from CT-P13 to SB2; 12 of them (33.3%) had already switched from reference Infliximab to CT-P13, and for the remaining patients CT-P13 was the first infliximab. The clinical remission rate six months before and three months after SB2-switch was the same (58.3%) and the rate of mild activity varied from 27.8 to 33.3% (P = 0.68); the percentage of patients with normal CRP values passed from 94.4 to 91.7% (P = 1). Two patients (5.5%) had AE and 11 (30.5%) a LOR. At univariate analysis, patients with a single switch had a non-significant risk of LOR during SB2 [odds ratio (OR) = 7.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-71, P = 0.06]. SB2-LOR was associated with previous AE under CT-P13 (OR = 9.1, 95% CI 0.82-100, P = 0.07). None of such factors was significant at multivariate analysis.
Switching from CT-P13 to SB2 seems to be safe and effective either in patients with a single than in those with multiple switches.

Title: The performance of Remicade®-optimized quantification assays in the assessment of Flixabi® levels.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30263065
Abstract: The advent of Remicade® biosimilars, Remsima®, Inflectra® and, more recently, Flixabi®, has brought along the potential to decrease the costs associated with this therapy, therefore increasing its access to a larger group of patients. However, and in order to assure a soft transition, one must make sure the assays and algorithms previously developed and optimized for Remicade perform equally well with its biosimilars. This study aimed to: (a) validate the utilization of Remicade-optimized therapeutic drug monitoring assays for the quantification of Flixabi; and (b) determine the existence of Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi cross-immunogenicity.
Healthy donors' sera spiked with Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were quantified using three different Remicade-quantification assays, and the reactivity of anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera to Remicade and to its biosimilars was assessed.
The results show that all tested Remicade-infliximab-optimized assays measure Flixabi as accurately as they measure Remicade and Remsima: the intraclass correlation coefficients between theoretical and measured concentrations varied from 0.920 to 0.990. Moreover, the interassay agreement values for the same compounds were high (intraclass correlation coefficients varied from 0.936 to 0.995). Finally, the anti-Remicade and anti-Remsima sera reacted to the different drugs in a similar fashion.
The tested assays can be used to monitor Flixabi levels. Moreover, Remicade, Remsima and Flixabi were shown to have a high cross-immunogenicity, which supports their high similarity but prevents their switching in nonresponders with antidrug antibodies.

Title: Human parainfluenza virus fusion complex glycoproteins imaged in action on authentic viral surfaces.
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956394
Abstract: Infection by human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) causes widespread lower respiratory diseases, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, and there are no vaccines or effective treatments for these viruses. HPIV3 is a member of the Respirovirus species of the Paramyxoviridae family. These viruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with genomes composed of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. During viral entry, the first step of infection, the viral fusion complex, comprised of the receptor-binding glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion glycoprotein (F), mediates fusion upon receptor binding. The HPIV3 transmembrane protein HN, like the receptor-binding proteins of other related viruses that enter host cells using membrane fusion, binds to a receptor molecule on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers the F glycoprotein to undergo major conformational rearrangements, promoting viral entry. Subsequent fusion of the viral and host membranes allows delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The intermediate states in viral entry are transient and thermodynamically unstable, making it impossible to understand these transitions using standard methods, yet understanding these transition states is important for expanding our knowledge of the viral entry process. In this study, we use cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to dissect the stepwise process by which the receptor-binding protein triggers F-mediated fusion, when forming a complex with receptor-bearing membranes. Using an on-grid antibody capture method that facilitates examination of fresh, biologically active strains of virus directly from supernatant fluids and a series of biological tools that permit the capture of intermediate states in the fusion process, we visualize the series of events that occur when a pristine, authentic viral particle interacts with target receptors and proceeds from the viral entry steps of receptor engagement to membrane fusion.

Title: Long-term effectiveness and pharmacokinetics of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 after switching from the originator during the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
Publication Date: 2022-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33115797
Abstract: Switching patients from the originator infliximab to a biosimilar is a measure to expand access to treatments and counteract its negative impact on healthcare budgets. However, industry-independent long-term studies on the effect of switching in real life to support the lack of switch-related problems in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are sparse, as are studies addressing infliximab pharmacokinetic behaviour. The objectives were to investigate the effectiveness and the pharmacokinetics of CT-P13 after switching from originator infliximab in a real-world population of IBD patients with a follow-up of 2 years.
Prospective, single-centre, observational 2 year study conducted in IBD adult patients with stable disease treated with the originator infliximab who were switched to CT-P13. Four time points were defined for follow-up: prior to the switch, 4-8 weeks after the switch, 8 months later, and 2 years later. Outcome measures were the proportion of patients with clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission, and changes in biochemical inflammation markers (albumin, C-reactive protein, faecal calprotectin) and infliximab clearance.
42 IBD patients were switched, of which 36 (85.7%) remained on CT-P13 throughout the 2 year study period. Only two patients discontinued CT-P13 due to loss of response. The proportion of patients who displayed clinical, endoscopic and biochemical remission were unchanged during the follow-up (p&lt;0.05) and no statistically significant changes were observed in the biochemical markers of disease activity. The median (IQR) clearance estimated for the infliximab originator before the change was 0.364 (0.321-0.415) L/day, and for the CT-P13 biosimilar it was 0.361 (0.323-0.415) L/day 4-8 weeks after the change, and 0.370 (0.334-0.419) L/day 2 years after (p=0.395).
Switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar CT-P13 did not affect the long-term clinical outcomes or the pharmacokinetic behaviour. This information provides the clinician more evidence for the success of switching and supports non-medical switching in adult IBD patients.

Title: A single nucleotide substitution in the internal ribosome entry site of foot-and-mouth disease virus leads to enhanced cap-independent translation in vivo.
Publication Date: 1993-Jul-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8389904
Abstract: Mutants of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) with altered biological properties can be selected during the course of persistent infection of BHK-21 cells with FMDV C-S8c1 (J. C. de la Torre, E. Martínez-Salas, J. Díez, A. Villaverde, F. Gebauer, E. Rocha, M. Dávila, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 62:2050-2058, 1988). Two nucleotide substitutions, U to C at position -376 and A to G at position -15, (counting as +1 the A of the first functional AUG), were fixed within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of R100, the virus rescued after 100 passages of the carrier BHK-21 cells. IRES-directed cap-independent protein synthesis was quantitated by using bicistronic constructs of the form chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene-IRES-luciferase gene. The IRES from R100 was 1.5- to 5-fold more active than that of C-S8c1 in directing cap-independent luciferase synthesis. This enhanced translational activity was observed when the RNAs were transcribed either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm by a weak or a strong promoter, respectively. C-S8c1 and R100 IRES elements were functional in both FMDV-sensitive and FMDV-resistant cells (including persistently infected R cells), indicating that factors mediating cap-independent protein synthesis are not limited in any of the analyzed cell lines. Constructs in which each of the two mutations in the R100 IRES were analyzed separately indicate that the transition at position -376 is responsible for the enhanced activity of the R100 IRES. By estimating the effect that an increase in the initial translation efficiency may have on subsequent RNA replication steps, we suggest that the modifications in the IRES elements can account for the previously described hypervirulence of FMDV R100 for BHK-21 cells. The results show that a single point mutation in an IRES element of a picornavirus can cause an increase in translation efficiency.

Title: Expanded access to cancer treatments from conversion to neutropenia prophylaxis with biosimilar filgrastim-sndz.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01

Abstract: Biosimilar medicines offer significant cost-savings potential over their reference products, which can be re-allocated to provide access to other cancer treatments on a budget-neutral basis.
Simulation study using cost data for the USA under consideration of several prophylaxis patterns.
Potential savings from conversion from reference filgrastim to biosimilar filgrastim-sndz are significant. These savings expand budget-neutral access to novel immunotherapies (obinutuzumab; pembrolizumab) or supportive care (filgrastim-sndz).
The combination of biosimilar savings and expanded access increases the value of cancer care as the same supportive care is provided at lower cost, additional cancer care is enabled at no additional cost, and more patients will have access to cancer care.

Title: A Markov model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of antiangiogenesis therapy using bevacizumab in advanced cervical cancer.
Publication Date: 2015-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25766118
Abstract: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in recurrent/persistent and metastatic cervical cancer using recently reported updated survival and toxicology data.
A Markov decision tree based on the Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 randomized trial was created. The 2013 MediCare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule provided costs. In the 5-year model subjects transitioned through the following states: response, progression, minor complications, severe complications, and death. Patients experiencing a health utility per month according to treatment effectiveness were calculated. Because cervical cancer survival is measured in months rather than years, results were reported in both quality adjusted cervical cancer life months and years (QALmonth, QALY), adjusted from a baseline of having advanced cervical cancer during a month.
The estimated total cost of therapy with bevacizumab is approximately 13.2 times that for chemotherapy alone, adding $73,791 per 3.5months (0.29year) of life gained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21.083 per month of added life. The ICER increased to $5775 per month of added life and $24,597/QALmonth ($295,164/QALY) due to the smaller difference in QALmonths. With 75% bevacizumab cost reduction, the ICER is $6737/QALmonth ($80,844/QALY), which translates to $23,580 for the 3.5month (0.29year) gain in OS.
Increased costs are primarily related to the cost of drug and not the management of bevacizumab-induced complications. Cost reductions in bevacizumab result in dramatic declines in the ICER, suggesting that cost reconciliation in advanced cervical cancer may be possible through the availability of biosimilars, and/or less expensive, equally efficacious anti-angiogenesis agents.

Title: Different Policy Measures and Practices between Swedish Counties Influence Market Dynamics: Part 2-Biosimilar and Originator Etanercept in the Outpatient Setting.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945206
Abstract: Diverging approaches towards market entry and uptake of biosimilars, even within a country, leads to regional variation in biosimilar use. This is the case in Sweden, where the 21 county councils control the healthcare budget and offer regional guidance.
This study aimed to analyse the market dynamics of originator and biosimilar etanercept (outpatient setting) in the different counties of Sweden, and examine the influence of local policy measures and practices, in addition to national policy.
This study was performed in three steps: (1) a structured review of the literature on (biosimilar) policies in Sweden; (2) analysis of market data on the counties' originator and biosimilar etanercept uptake (quarter two 2012 to quarter four 2017) provided by IQVIA™; and (3) discussion of findings in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with the national pricing and reimbursement agency, key experts in the county councils of Skåne, Västra Götaland and Stockholm, and an industry representative.
Notwithstanding the existence of a national managed entry agreement for etanercept, wide variations in biosimilar market shares between counties were observed (40-82% in 2017). Over time, early and late adopters of biosimilar etanercept can be distinguished. In quarter four 2017, biosimilar market shares of all counties slightly decreased in accordance with the lower priced originator product from 1 October 2017. As prescriptions for treatment with etanercept are often provided for a year, two approaches are possible to switch patients: active pullback of prescriptions resulting in additional workload, or wait until the patient's next visit. Qualitative analysis indicated that the choice to use the biosimilar or the originator product depends on differences in rebated prices of the biosimilar and originator product, the presence of key opinion leaders, local guidelines, and financial streams and local gainsharing arrangements. Our estimates of current rebated prices and costs after gainsharing for the county councils and Government reveal only limited price differences between products.
Regional variations in use of biosimilar etanercept can be seen although prices are coordinated nationally. This suggests that counties react differently to price differences and highlights the role of local policy and attitudes of stakeholders towards biosimilars and switching. It seems that some counties are hesitant to switch patients, as it is associated with an increased administrative workload that might not be compensated for by savings associated with a lower priced product.

Title: A conserved G₁ regulatory circuit promotes asynchronous behavior of nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm.
Publication Date: 2010-Sep-15
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20930528
Abstract: Synthesis and accumulation of conserved cell cycle regulators such as cyclins are thought to promote G₁/S and G₂/M transitions in most eukaryotes. When cells at different stages of the cell cycle are fused to form heterokaryons, the shared complement of regulators in the cytoplasm induces the nuclei to become synchronized. However, multinucleate fungi often display asynchronous nuclear division cycles, even though the nuclei inhabit a shared cytoplasm. Similarly, checkpoints can induce nuclear asynchrony in multinucleate cells by arresting only the nucleus that receives damage. The cell biological basis for nuclear autonomy in a common cytoplasm is not known. Here we show that in the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, sister nuclei born from one mitosis immediately lose synchrony in the subsequent G₁ interval. A conserved G₁ transcriptional regulatory circuit involving the Rb-analogue Whi5p promotes the asynchronous behavior yet Whi5 protein is uniformly distributed among nuclei throughout the cell cycle. The homologous Whi5p circuit in S. cerevisiae employs positive feedback to promote robust and coherent entry into the cell cycle. We propose that positive feedback in this same circuit generates timing variability in a multinucleate cell. These unexpected findings indicate that a regulatory program whose products (mRNA transcripts) are translated in a common cytoplasm can nevertheless promote variability in the individual behavior of sister nuclei.

Title: Low-molecular-weight heparin biosimilars: potential implications for clinical practice. Australian Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Biosimilar Working Group (ALBW).
Publication Date: 2014-May-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24816308
Abstract: A working group of clinicians and scientists was formed to review the clinical considerations for use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) biosimilars. LMWH are biological molecules of significant complexity; the full complexity of chemical structure is still to be elucidated. LMWH biosimilars are products that are biologically similar to their reference product and rely on clinical data from a reference product to establish safety and efficacy. The complex nature of LMWH molecules means that it is uncertain whether a LMWH biosimilar is chemically identical to its reference product; this introduces the possibility of differences in activity and immunogenicity. The challenge for regulators and clinicians is to evaluate the level of evidence required to demonstrate that a LMWH is sufficiently similar to the reference product. The consensus opinion of the working group is that prior to clinical use a LMWH biosimilar should have proven efficacy and safety, similar to the reference product with prospective studies, which should be confirmed with a proactive post-marketing pharmacovigilance programme.

Title: Efficacy of once or twice weekly administration of epoetin κ in patients receiving hemodialysis: A retrospective study.
Publication Date: 2014-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24348759
Abstract: Several clinically approved recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) preparations, such as epoetin-β, epoetin-δ and the epoetin-α derivative, darbepoetin-α, have been commercially produced. Since the expiration of patent protection, a number of novel rEPO biosimilars have been approved on the world market. In 2010, epoetin-κ, which is biosimilar to epoetin-α, was clinically approved. Epoetin-κ is a biopharmaceutical product that is based on serum-free media following master cell bank preparation. The present study analyzes the results obtained during a six-month observation period, in which the administration of epoetin-β was switched to that of epoetin-κ. In a cohort of patients receiving chronic dialysis, who were clinically in a state of relative calm and were in control of their renal anemia, it was possible to sustain good control of the anemia by reducing the frequency of the epoetin-β administration from the conventional and empirically determined three times a week to twice a week, and further to once a week. Furthermore, the good control was maintained upon changing from the administration of epoetin-β to that of epoetin-κ. Moreover, three months subsequent to this switch, the degree of instability observed among the patients had decreased. Despite the fact that the situation following the changeover requires further investigation, it may be concluded that the results obtained in this study are indicative of the clinical equivalence and efficacy of epoetin-κ.

Title: The Legal and Regulatory Status of Biosimilars: How Product Naming and State Substitution Laws May Impact the United States Healthcare System.
Publication Date: 2015-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26237983
Abstract: Alongside the constitutional controversy ultimately addressed by the Supreme Court, the colossal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) ushered in a new paradigm for regulation of biologics by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nestled within the expansive ACA, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) set forth an abbreviated pathway to market for "biosimilar" and "interchangeable" biological products. While the current BPCIA implementation debate focuses chiefly on the scope of scientific and technical assessments by the FDA and the effect on the emergent biosimilar industry, two issues will prove essential for determinations of access to and costs of the resulting products: how the biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar biologics are to be named, and whether pharmacist substitution is appropriate for products the FDA deems interchangeable. This article examines the current debate surrounding the use of nonproprietary names for biosimilar biologics, as well as state efforts to reconcile automatic substitution laws for the eventual products. In particular, the article addresses the implications for patients and the United States health care system, highlighting the potential negative effect on anticipated cost-savings, hindrances for effective tracking and reporting of adverse events, and a general lack of consistency in state laws.

Title: Public Health Impact of Using Biosimilars, Is Automated Follow up Relevant?
Publication Date: 2020-Dec-29
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383867
Abstract: Biologic reference drugs and their copies, biosimilars, have a complex structure. Biosimilars need to demonstrate their biosimilarity during development but unpredictable variations can remain, such as micro-heterogeneity. The healthcare community may raise questions regarding the clinical outcomes induced by this micro-heterogeneity. Indeed, unwanted immune reactions may be induced for numerous reasons, including product variations. However, it is challenging to assess these unwanted immune reactions because of the multiplicity of causes and potential delays before any reaction. Moreover, safety assessments as part of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be of limited value with respect to immunogenicity assessments because they are performed on a standardised population during a limited period. Real-life data could therefore supplement the assessments of clinical trials by including data on the real-life use of biosimilars, such as switches. Furthermore, real-life data also include any economic incentives to prescribe or use biosimilars. This article raises the question of relevance of automating real life data processing regarding Biosimilars. The objective is to initiate a discussion about different approaches involving Machine Learning. So, the discussion is established regarding implementation of Neural Network model to ensure safety of biosimilars subject to economic incentives. Nevertheless, the application of Machine Learning in the healthcare field raises ethical, legal and technical issues that require further discussion.

Title: Switching to an Infliximab Biosimilar Was Safe and Effective in Dutch Sarcoidosis Patients.
Publication Date: 2021-Feb-19
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33669641
Abstract: The effect of switching from originator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab in patients with sarcoidosis is unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of switching from Remicade<sup>®</sup> or Inflectra<sup>®</sup> to Flixabi<sup>®</sup> in patients with severe refractory sarcoidosis. This single center retrospective cohort study was performed at St Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein, The Netherlands. All patients diagnosed with severe refractory sarcoidosis receiving Remicade<sup>®</sup> or Inflectra<sup>®</sup> switched to Flixabi<sup>®</sup>. The primary outcome was infliximab discontinuation within 6 months of switching. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and loss of clinical, functional, or inflammatory response. Out of 86 patients who switched to Flixabi<sup>®</sup>, 79 patients had complete data. None of the 79 patients discontinued infliximab during the first 6 months after switching. Five patients reported an adverse event related to Flixabi<sup>®</sup> treatment. We found no change from baseline in FVC, FEV1, DLCOc, 6MWT, and infliximab trough levels 26 weeks after switching. An improvement in physical functioning of 7.3 ± 13.4 points (<i>p</i> = 0.002) with RAND/SF36 and in biomarker sIL-2R (-475.58 ± 1452.39; <i>p</i> = 0.005) was observed. Switching from originator infliximab Remicade<sup>®</sup> or biosimilar infliximab Inflectra<sup>®</sup> to biosimilar infliximab Flixabi<sup>®</sup> did not result in treatment discontinuation or loss of clinical/functional/inflammatory remission.

Title: Real-World Evaluation of Dosing in Patients Converted From Insulin Glargine (Lantus) to Insulin Glargine (Basaglar).
Publication Date: 2020-Sep-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32037850
Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Basaglar, insulin glargine (BGlar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a follow-on biologic, was developed after the patent for Lantus, insulin glargine (LGlar; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) expired. <b>Objective:</b> To compare the dosing and hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> (A1C)-lowering effects of BGlar compared with LGlar in a real-world setting. <b>Methods:</b> Adult patients, at 5 clinics, with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were converted from LGlar to BGlar were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome compared mean basal insulin dose (U/d) from the date of conversion to 6 months. Basal insulin and total daily insulin doses were also compared from baseline to 3- and 12-months postconversion, as also change in A1C, body weight, and estimated monthly acquisition costs of basal insulin. <b>Results:</b> Of the 225 patients included, 56% were male, and 81% had T2DM. The mean conversion dose (U/d) of LGlar was 46.3 ± 32.7. There was no significant difference in the mean BGlar dose (U/d) at 6 months (45.9 ± 33.5; <i>P</i> = 0.52), nor was there a statistical difference at 3 or 12 months. There were no significant differences in change in A1C at any time point. The estimated monthly acquisition cost of BGlar was significantly less than that for LGlar at conversion ($286 vs $341, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and 6 months ($290 vs $351, <i>P</i> < 0.001) respectively. <b>Conclusion/Relevance:</b> The results of this retrospective study suggest that BGlar resulted in similar glycemic outcomes compared with LGlar in a real-world setting and may be a preferable option in a value-based health care environment.

Title: Implementation of CT-P13 via a Managed Switch Programme in Crohn's Disease: 12-Month Real-World Outcomes.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535885
Abstract: Switching from Remicade to CT-P13 allows for significant cost savings and has been shown to be non-inferior to continued therapy with Remicade for the treatment of Crohn's disease.
The aim of this work was to prospectively evaluate clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease switching from Remicade to CT-P13.
A prospective service evaluation was performed. The Harvey-Bradshaw index, CRP, faecal calprotectin and serum for infliximab/antibody levels were collected prior to patients' final Remicade infusion and at 6 and 12 months after switching to CT-P13 as part of routine clinical care. All adverse events during follow-up were also recorded.
One hundred and ten patients on Remicade switched to CT-P13. No significant difference was observed between the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (p = 0.07), CRP (p = 0.13), faecal calprotectin (p = 0.25) or trough infliximab levels (p = 0.47) comparing before and at 6 and 12 months after the switch to CT-P13. Seven patients developed new infliximab antibodies after switching from Remicade to CT-P13. The majority of patients remained on CT-P13 at 12 months (84.5%) and the rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was 53.8 and 13.5 per 100 patient-years of follow-up, respectively. Switching to CT-P13 resulted in a cost saving of approximately 46.4%.
The transition to CT-P13 from Remicade for the treatment of Crohn's disease is safe and has no negative effect on clinical outcomes at 12 months.

Abstract: The first biosimilar version of a biologic agent used to treat psoriasis (infliximab) entered the Spanish market on February 16 of this year, and more biosimilars can be expected to follow in the coming months and years. Logically, this new situation will have economic repercussions and alter prescribing patterns among dermatologists. In this second part of the review, we will look at several somewhat contentious issues, such as the extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, and automatic substitution. We will also review the biosimilars with indications for psoriasis currently in the clinical development pipeline and assess their potential to offer comparable efficacy and safety to the reference product while contributing to the sustainability of the public health care system.

Title: Quality, Non-clinical and Clinical Considerations for Biosimilar Monoclonal Antibody Development: EU, WHO, USA, Canada, and BRICS-TM Regulatory Guidelines.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30364154
Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> The aim was to critically evaluate well-established regulatory agencies mAb biosimilar guidelines for development and marketing authorization about quality, efficacy and safety and compare to BRICS-TM regulations to identify challenges. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The current valid guidelines of EMA, WHO, USFDA, BGTD/HC, ICH, and BRICS-TM were obtained from official websites and comparative qualitative review was performed. <b>Results:</b> The review revealed that Health Canada uses mAb specific guidelines from EMA or USFDA when necessary. The BRICS agencies (except Russia) have incorporated some or most of the WHO SBP TRS and related annexes in similar national biotechnological/biological guidelines; however, gaps or insufficient information have been identified. The Russian Federation has issued general product registration guideline/s with very brief information about mAbs. The TMMDA (Turkey) has published an updated biosimilar guideline which parallels those of the EMA and the ones from WHO; however, no mAb specific guidelines are published. COFEPRIS (Mexico) has published a biotechnological/biological product registration guideline with no information about mAb. The SAHPRA biosimilar guideline has an annex on mAbs which focuses on non-clinical and clinical aspects. The comparative evaluation of BRICS-TM agencies indicates a gap pertaining to clarification for physico-chemical characterization, manufacturing process, overages and compatibility requirements between biological substances and excipients specifically on mAbs. <i>In vitro</i> assay requirements seem quite aligned with those of WHO, whereas <i>in vivo</i> studies mostly have disparity in terms of necessity, type of studies as well as design and criteria. Clinical safety and efficacy studies are indicated in emerging regulatory agencies, however detailed information pertaining to design, size of populations, requirements for primary and secondary endpoints, clarity and evaluation criteria differ. In general, BRICS-TM agencies allow extrapolation of indications provided that pre-defined conditions are met. Interchangeability, switching and substitution of biosimilars are not defined in most of BRIC-TM guidelines whereas South Africa, by law, allows neither interchangeability nor substitution. Pediatric research remains questionable across BRICS-TM. <b>Conclusions:</b> EMA, USFDA guidelines are broadly aligned with WHO and in addition, they also contain specific requirements pertaining to their own region. BRICS-TM has considerably less defined mAb specific biosimilar development and comparability parameters in their published guidelines.

Title: Biosimilars in oncology: from development to clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2014-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24767633
Abstract: Biologics play an integral role in the treatment of cancer not only for their therapeutic effects and ability to improve outcomes, but also as supportive care agents. Biologics are more complex to manufacture and take longer to bring to market. Because biologics are considerably more costly than small-molecule drugs, their use has placed an increasing economic demand on healthcare systems worldwide. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar to existing branded biologics, but because biologics cannot be exactly copied, biosimilars should not be referred to as generic, exact versions of the innovator biologic. Biosimilars have the potential to increase access and provide lower cost options for cancer care as patent protection for some of the most widely used biologics begins to expire. Regulatory requirements for biosimilars are evolving, as are global harmonization and/or standardization strategies that can facilitate their robust clinical development. This review highlights critical factors involved with the integration of biosimilars into oncology treatment paradigms and practices. Clinicians will likely seek out practice guidelines and position statements from established scientific societies to help evaluate key information regarding biosimilars, such as efficacy, safety, comparability, and interchangeability with the reference biologic. Automatic substitution, nomenclature, extrapolation of clinical data from one indication to another, as well as parameters for ongoing pharmacovigilance are evolving considerations. Education of physicians and other healthcare providers, payers, and patients about biosimilars may facilitate informed decision making, promote acceptance of biosimilars into clinical practice, increase accessibility, and expedite associated health and economic benefits.

Publication Date: 2020-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32054272
Abstract: there are no studies in the literature about the effectiveness of adalimumab biosimilar ABP 501 in Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate its effectiveness and safety.
an observational study was performed in Crohn's disease patients treated with ABP 501, with the classic induction and maintenance regimen and in Crohn's disease patients who were switched from the adalimumab originator to ABP 501.
eighty-seven patients were included in the study, of which 25 were naïve to the adalimumab originator and 62 were switched to ABP 501. In adalimumab-naïve patients, clinical response at three months was 60% (15/25) and clinical remission at three months was 56% (14/25). At six months, 95.2% (59/62) of the patients switched to ABP 501 were still in therapy, without a significant increase of clinical activity (Harvey-Bradshaw index from 3.4, 95% CI = 2.4-4.4, to 3.8, 95% CI = 2.7-4.9, p = 0.23) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein from 4.2 mg/l, 95% CI = 2.5-5.9 mg/l, to 3.6 mg/l, 95% CI = 2.2-5 mg/l, p = 0.32). There were no unexpected adverse events during the study period.
our results support ABP 501 as an effective and well-tolerated drug, with a good interchangeability with its originator for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

Title: Use and costs of originator and biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia: real-world evidence from an Italian hospital.
Publication Date: 2019-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30468397
Abstract: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate adherence, switch and costs a year after the start of treatment with different erythropoietin-stimulating agents. There were 277 patients, 200 were originators (72.20%) and 77 (27.80%) were biosimilars. Adherence to treatment for originators is 0.84 ± 0.22 versus 0.76 ± 0.27 for biosimilars (p = 0.3241). Medication adherence was calculated as ratio between received daily dose to prescribed daily dose. The optimum value is 1, values less than 1 indicate loss of adherence.  The cost of treatment per year is €7365 per patient for the use of the originator drug versus €2587 for biosimilars, with a difference of €4777 per patient.

Title: Challenges constraining availability and affordability of insulin in Bengaluru region (Karnataka, India): evidence from a mixed-methods study.
Publication Date: 2019-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31636912
Abstract: Considering limited global access to affordable insulin, we evaluated insulin access in public and private health sectors in Bengaluru, India.
Employing modified WHO/HAI methodology, we used mixed-methods analysis to study insulin access and factors influencing insulin supply and demand in Bengaluru in December 2017. We assessed insulin availability, price and affordability in a representative sample of 5 public-sector hospitals, 5 private-sector hospitals and 30 retail pharmacies. We obtained insulin price data from websites of government Jan Aushadhi scheme (JAS) and four online private-sector retail pharmacies. We interviewed wholesalers in April 2018 to understand insulin market dynamics.
Mean availability of insulins on India's 2015 Essential Medicine List was 66.7% in the public sector, lower than private-sector retail (76.1%) and hospital pharmacies (93.3%). Among private retailers, mean availability was higher among chain (96.7%) than independent pharmacies (68.3%). Non-Indian companies supplied 67.3% products in both sectors. 79.1% products were manufactured in India, of which 60% were marketed by non-Indian companies.In private retail pharmacies, median consumer prices of human insulin cartridges and pens were 2.5 and 3.6 times, respectively, that of human insulin vials. Analogues depending on delivery device were twice as expensive as human insulin. Human insulin vials were 18.3% less expensive in JAS pharmacies than private retail pharmacies. The lowest paid unskilled worker would pay 1.4 to 9.3 days' wages for a month's supply, depending on insulin type and health sector. Wholesaler interviews suggest that challenges constraining patient insulin access include limited market competition, physicians' preference for non-Indian insulins, and the ongoing transition from human to analogue insulin. Rising popularity of online and chain pharmacies may influence insulin access.
Insulin availability in Bengaluru's public sector falls short of WHO's 80% target. Insulin remains unaffordable in both private and public sectors. To improve insulin availability and affordability, government should streamline insulin procurement and supply chains at different levels, mandate biosimilar prescribing, educate physicians to pursue evidence-based prescribing, and empower pharmacists with brand substitution. Patients must be encouraged to shop around for lower prices from subsidized schemes like JAS. While non-Indian companies dominate Bengaluru's insulin market, rising market competition from Indian companies may improve access.

Title: Strengths, weaknesses and future challenges of biosimilars' development. An opinion on how to improve the knowledge and use of biosimilars in clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2017-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29113760
Abstract: Biosimilars started receiving the marketing authorization by European Medicine Agency since 2006. The development of biosimilars follows a well-defined step-wise approach, the so-called comparability exercise, which aims to compare non-clinical (mainly quality features and biological activity) and clinical (efficacy and safety profiles) features of new biosimilars with their respective reference products. Despite the undeniable advantages of such procedure, some concerns (such as the absence of switching studies or the evaluation of efficacy and safety in all therapeutic indications) still exist about its. In particular, the European regulatory framework on biosimilars approval does not include the conduction of switching studies demonstrating the interchangeability to be carried out before marketing authorization. This is one of the main aspects that negatively affects healthcare professionals' clinical decisions on switch. In order to achieve a better knowledge on safety and efficacy of biosimilar drugs, real world data should be collected and post-marketing efficacy and safety clinical studies (including those evaluating specific endpoints, therapeutic regimens and patients population), should be planned. also the conduction of well-designed switching studies is highly advisable, especially in the case of biosimilar drugs used in oncology settings. Lastly, considering the critical role of antidrug antibodies on efficacy/safety profile of biologic drugs, studies based on therapeutic drug monitoring would be useful in order to achieve treatment optimization. Implementing the above strategies could be helpful to fill the gap in knowledge observed in the present European biosimilar regulatory framework.

Title: Randomized Controlled Trial: Subcutaneous vs Intravenous Infliximab CT-P13 Maintenance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
Publication Date: 2021-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676969
Abstract: This study compared pharmacokinetics, symptomatic and endoscopic efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a subcutaneous formulation of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 (CT-P13 SC) vs intravenous CT-P13 (CT-P13 IV) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
This randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, phase 1 study enrolled tumor necrosis factor inhibitor-naïve patients with active ulcerative colitis (total Mayo score 6-12 points with endoscopic subscore ≥2) or Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index 220-450 points) at 50 centers. After CT-P13 IV induction at Week (W) 0/W2, patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P13 SC every 2 weeks (q2w) from W6 to W54 or CT-P13 IV every 8 weeks from W6 to W22. At W30, all patients receiving CT-P13 IV switched to CT-P13 SC q2w until W54. The primary endpoint was noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV for observed predose CT-P13 concentration at W22 (C<sub>trough,W22</sub>), concluded if the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric least-squares means exceeded 80%.
Overall, 66 and 65 patients were randomized to CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV, respectively. The primary endpoint of noninferiority was met with a geometric least-squares means ratio for C<sub>trough,W22</sub> of 1154.17% (90% CI 786.37-1694.00; n = 59 [CT-P13 SC]; n = 57 [CT-P13 IV]). W30/W54 clinical remission rates were comparable between arms. Other efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity assessments were also broadly comparable between arms, including after switching.
The pharmacokinetic noninferiority of CT-P13 SC to CT-P13 IV, and the comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity profiles, support the potential suitability of CT-P13 SC treatment in IBD. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02883452.

Title: EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: 2019 update.
Publication Date: 2020-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969328
Abstract: To provide an update of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management recommendations to account for the most recent developments in the field.
An international task force considered new evidence supporting or contradicting previous recommendations and novel therapies and strategic insights based on two systematic literature searches on efficacy and safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) since the last update (2016) until 2019. A predefined voting process was applied, current levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned and participants ultimately voted independently on their level of agreement with each of the items.
The task force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 12 recommendations concerning use of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); glucocorticoids (GCs); biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, sarilumab and biosimilar (bs) DMARDs) and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs (the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and tapering on sustained clinical remission is provided. Cost and sequencing of b/tsDMARDs are addressed. Initially, MTX plus GCs and upon insufficient response to this therapy within 3 to 6 months, stratification according to risk factors is recommended. With poor prognostic factors (presence of autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD or JAK inhibitor should be added to the csDMARD. If this fails, any other bDMARD (from another or the same class) or tsDMARD is recommended. On sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered, but not be stopped. Levels of evidence and levels of agreement were mostly high.
These updated EULAR recommendations provide consensus on the management of RA with respect to benefit, safety, preferences and cost.

Title: LBEC0101, an etanercept biosimilar for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Publication Date: 2021-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801395
Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionized by the introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. With patent expiry approaching for many expensive biologic molecules, such as etanercept, more affordable biosimilar drugs are being developed. LBEC0101 is an etanercept biosimilar approved in Japan and South Korea for all etanercept indications including RA. <b>Areas covered</b>: We discuss the pharmacological characteristics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of LBEC0101 compared with the etanercept reference product (ETN-RP). Preclinical studies showed that the binding affinity to TNFα and biological activity of LBEC0101 were similar to those of the ETN-RP. The pharmacokinetic profile of LBEC0101 was also similar to that of the ETN-RP. A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, 54-week study showed that the efficacy of LBEC0101 was equivalent to that of the ETN-RP in RA patients. An extension study showed that efficacy was sustained long-term in patients receiving LBEC0101 and in those switching from the ETN-RP to LBEC0101. The safety profile of LBEC0101 was also confirmed to be comparable with the ETN-RP. <b>Expert opinion</b>: LBEC0101 has shown equivalent pharmacokinetics and efficacy and comparable safety to the ETN-RP, and the lower cost of LBEC0101 provides a good cost-benefit ratio.

Title: Biologics, Pharmacovigilance, and Patient Safety: It's All in the Name.
Publication Date: 2016-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27459655
Abstract: The most appropriate naming convention for biologics and biosimilars has been an area of significant debate. The ultimate decision will have an impact on patient safety, pharmacovigilance program effectiveness, and, potentially, the overall adoption of biosimilars in the United States. This article reviews some of the advantages and disadvantages of various naming approaches. For clarity in communication, optimal pharmacovigilance, and patient safety, it is recommended that biosimilars be named with a common USAN (United States Adopted Name) with the reference product, along with a suffix that is memorable, such as one associated with the original manufacturer of the product. This approach supports the FDA's mission of protecting patient safety and public health, while minimizing the possibility of inadvertent switching of products and facilitating effective pharmacovigilance.

Title: Comparative Safety of Originator and Biosimilar Epoetin Alfa Drugs: An Observational Prospective Multicenter Study.
Publication Date: 2018-Aug-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30030767
Abstract: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are biological molecules approved for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Biosimilars were licensed for use in Europe in 2007.
This study aimed to compare the safety profile of biosimilars with respect to the reference product in a nephrology setting.
A prospective study was conducted in four Italian regions between 1 October 2013 and 30 June 2015. The study population included patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing hemodialysis and treated with epoetins as per the clinical practice of the participating centers. The two comparison cohorts included patients treated with either an originator or a biosimilar epoetin alfa. Each patient was followed up until occurrence of any safety outcome of interest (grouped into three major categories), switch to a different ESA product, transplant or peritoneal dialysis, death, or end of the study period, whichever came first.
Overall, 867 subjects were included in the study (originator: N = 423; biosimilar: N = 444). Biosimilar users were older than originator users (median age of 76 vs 64 years, respectively), more frequently affected by arrhythmia (29.3 vs 22.5%), and less frequently candidates for transplantation (3.8 vs 18.2%). Cox-regression analysis showed no increase in risk of safety outcomes in biosimilar users, even after adjusting for confounding factors: 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.3) for any outcomes; 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.8) for problems related to dialysis device; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for cardio- and cerebro-vascular conditions; 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for infections.
This study confirms the comparable safety profiles of originator and biosimilar epoetin alfa drugs when used in patients receiving dialysis.

Title: Comparison of Rituximab originator (MabThera) to biosimilar (Truxima) in patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Publication Date: 2019-Jun-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30919938
Abstract: Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is an acute, multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy mediated by ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) autoantibodies. Immunosuppression with anti-CD20 therapy is the mainstay of treatment. MabThera's patent has now expired and biosimilars have been approved. Eighty-four consecutive patient episodes over 2 years, prior to and following our switch to Truxima are presented. Day 1 (D1), Day 28 (D28) and 3-month platelet counts, ADAMTS13 activity, and CD19 levels, adverse reactions and infective complications were recorded. Platelet counts were not significantly different between acute MabThera and Truxima treatment (D1 P = 0.085, D28 P = 0.77, 3 months P = 0.71) and electively (D1 P = 0.79, D28 P = 0.68, 3 months P = 0.99). ADAMTS13 recovery also was not significantly different acutely (D1 P = 0.99, D28 P = 0.27, 3 months P = 0.26) and electively (D1 P = 0.59, D28 P = 0.61, 3 months P = 0.34). CD19% depletion at D1 and 3 months was not significantly different acutely (D1 P = 0.52, 3 months P = 0.56) and electively (D1 P = 0.22, 3 months P = 0.19). Infusion reactions and infective complications were comparable with both therapies. This is the first series of the Rituximab biosimilar Truxima to be reported in iTTP, demonstrating equivalence to MabThera in terms of ADAMTS13 recovery, CD19 depletion, and platelet count at D28 and 3 months post-administration, with comparable infusion and infective complications. The financial benefit of the biosimilar anti-CD20 is considerable.

Here is the assessment:

**Overall Eligibility:** No

Here are the answers to each criterion:

1. **TNFα inhibitor originator to biosimilar transition:** No
2. **Number of patients who retransitioned reported or calculable:** No
3. **Original research article in peer-reviewed journal:** No
4. **Baseline characteristics of patients who transitioned reported:** No
5. **Article written in English:** Yes
6. **Full-text version of article obtainable:** Yes

**Explanation:**
The article does not meet the eligibility criteria for several reasons. Firstly, it does not involve a study that transitions patients from a TNFα inhibitor originator to a biosimilar. The abstract suggests that the article provides an overview of the current evidence on biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease, but it does not report on a specific study involving transitioning patients. Additionally, there is no mention of the number of patients who retransitioned, which is another key criterion. The article also appears to be a review article rather than an original research article, which further excludes it from the systematic review.

Title: Physician attitudes about non-medical switching to biosimilars: results from an online physician survey in the United States.
Publication Date: 2019-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30712393
Abstract: This study was designed to understand the level of familiarity of US rheumatologists, gastroenterologists and dermatologists with biosimilar therapies, their experience with non-medical switching (switching medications for reasons unrelated to patient health) of patients between biologics and their attitudes towards switching from a biologic to a biosimilar.
A total of 297 US physicians who currently prescribe biologics for their patients completed a 15-minute online survey. Rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists were included.
The majority of physicians (84%) did not want stable patients undergoing a non-medical switch to a biosimilar. While 60% of physicians believed non-medical switching to biosimilars may have a positive impact on healthcare system costs, multiple negative impacts were also expected. A majority of physicians anticipated a negative impact on patient mental health (59%), treatment efficacy (57%), patient safety (53%) and physician office management (60%).
The majority of physicians had concerns regarding non-medical switching to biosimilars and the impact such switching would have on patient care and physician practice.

Title: Efficacy of infliximab as a switched biologic in rheumatoid arthritis patients in daily clinical practice.
Publication Date: 2018-Dec-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30632931
Abstract: To assess the efficacy and safety of switching to infliximab (IFX) from other biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) among Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in daily practice. We examined 24 consecutive RA patients who had not achieved low disease activity (LDA) as the disease activity score-28 for rheumatoid arthritis with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) despite previous bDMARD therapy in this cohort study. We attempted to determine predictive variables that are associated with achieving DAS28-ESR LDA at 22 weeks post-IFX introduction, by performing univariate analysis. The median DAS28-ESR at baseline was 5.41. Sixteen patients (66.7%) had been treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i), and the other eight patients (33.3%) received a non-TNF-i (abatacept or tocilizumab). Nine patients (37.5%) achieved LDA or remission at 22 weeks. Univariate analyses showed that the variable to predict LDA achievement at 22 weeks was tender joints (>8 counts) at baseline (adjusted odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63; p = .02). Nine adverse events were observed during the study period, and infection requiring hospitalization was observed in one patient. Switching to IFX is effective to achieve LDA or remission for RA patients refractory to bDMARDs.

Title: Perception of Originator Biologics and Biosimilars: A Survey Among Belgian Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients and Rheumatologists.
Publication Date: 2017-Oct-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28929342
Abstract: Among patients and rheumatologists, current knowledge and perception of biosimilars in comparison with originator biologics is unknown.
The aim of this study was to investigate this knowledge and perception in Belgian rheumatologists and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Anonymous web surveys were conducted in Belgian RA patients (n = 121) and rheumatologists (n = 41) during the period January-March 2016. The surveys covered topics on knowledge, similarity, price, preference, interchangeability, extrapolation and switching. Descriptive and statistical analyses of responses were performed.
Familiarity with biosimilars was reported by 49% of patients, of whom 77% knew what biosimilars were. RA patients equally questioned the proven efficacy of originators and biosimilars in RA, as well as their side effects and suitability. Furthermore, RA patients questioned the safety of biosimilars more often than that of originators (35 vs. 20%, respectively; p = 0.0094). Rheumatologists, more so than patients, expressed concerns that there might be differences between originators and biosimilars in terms of quality, safety, and price (p = 0.0292, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0129, respectively). The opinions of rheumatologists on interchangeability and extrapolation of indications varied. The price of an originator contributed substantially to the medicine preference of rheumatologists (p = 0.0002), but not patients.
Our study showed that rheumatologists, more so than patients, were convinced that there can be differences between originators and biosimilars. Despite safety being the major concern of patients, patients trusted their physician's decision to start on or switch to a biosimilar. The evolution of the uptake of biosimilars in Belgium might thus depend mainly on the perception of physicians.

Title: Cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis in Greece.
Publication Date: 2021-Mar-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976189
Abstract: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other treatment options currently available for the management of adult patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, who have had an inadequate response, loss of response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biologic agent, in Greece.
A Markov model was adapted for projecting lifetime costs and outcomes, for a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis from a Greek payer perspective. Patients entered the model in the active ulcerative colitis state and transitioned to a remission or response state or they underwent colectomy. Following an initial 8-week induction treatment period, patients received maintenance therapy until loss of response. Nonresponders could switch to up to two subsequent biologic lines. Clinical efficacy, adverse event rates and utilities derived from OCTAVE trials and a network-meta-analysis (NMA), while adverse event-related disutilities were obtained from the literature. Information on treatment pathways and resource use was provided by an advisory board due to a lack of local data. Unit costs derived from official national sources (€, 2018).
Over a life-time horizon, treating moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis with tofacitinib resulted in additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and lower total costs compared to vedolizumab (0.018; €6408), infliximab (biosimilar) (0.009; €3031), golimumab (0.042; €1988) and infliximab (originator) (0.009; €6724). Hence, tofacitinib was estimated to be dominant over all comparators.
The results of the analysis suggest that in the Greek setting, tofacitinib could be considered a cost-effective (dominant) treatment option for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis.

Title: [Opportunities and challenges of extrapolation for biosimilars].
Publication Date: 2016-Nov-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27711947
Abstract: Although biosimilars approved in the European Union have proved to be safe and efficacious, their licensing requirements continue to be disputed by medical professionals. In particular, extrapolation to indications of the originator without one's own clinical data of the biosimilar is controversial. Conceptually, the development of biosimilars is derived from that of generics. However, due to their complexity and inherent variability, considerably more data are necessary for biosimilars to demonstrate comparability with the originator (the reference product) than for the usually low-molecular generics. Biosimilars increase competition and help contain healthcare, and they improve access for patients to valuable treatments with biologicals. However, biosimilar development is a laborious and lengthy process and requires major biotechnological know-how. The basis is comprehensive, structural, and functional characterization of the biosimilar and reference product as well as their comparison with suitable and sensitive methods. The clinical development programme is reduced and tailored to address remaining uncertainties and to confirm comparable clinical performance. Extrapolation of data to other indications of the reference product is the greatest cost advantage of biosimilar development, but must always be scientifically justified and, if necessary, substantiated by further data. The scientific principles underlying the comparability exercise for a biosimilar are the same as those applied to a change in the manufacturing process of an already licensed biological. In both cases, different versions of a biological substance are compared and the clinical relevance of observed differences is assessed. Competent authorities do have decades of experience in evaluating changes in the manufacturing process, which they can now apply to biosimilars. For approval of a biosimilar and extrapolation of data, the totality of the evidence from the complete comparability exercise is considered, as has been the case for the first biosimilar infliximab.

Title: Biosimilar and Follow-on Insulin: The Ins, Outs, and Interchangeability.
Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861004
Abstract: <b>Objective:</b> To provide an overview of the differences between biosimilars and generics, and to summarize regulatory requirements and outstanding issues related to biosimilar insulins in the United States, including the issue of interchangeability. <b>Data Sources:</b> References were obtained using MEDLINE searches, the bibliographies of articles identified during the searches, review articles, and general Internet searches. Key words included the following: diabetes, insulin, biosimilar, regulatory, follow-on, and interchangeability. <b>Study Selection and Data Extraction:</b> Articles, studies, regulatory documents, and opinion pieces that addressed issues around biosimilar/follow-on insulins and interchangeability of insulins in people with diabetes were selected for inclusion in this narrative review. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> There is understandable interest in the potential for new <i>copies</i> of existing insulins-termed biosimilar insulins or follow-on insulins-to reduce the substantial and growing costs associated with managing the diabetes epidemic and to improve access, as has been achieved with conventional generic drugs. However, biosimilars or follow-on insulins are not generics. There are critical differences between biologic products and conventional chemical drugs, which present specific challenges to manufacturers, regulators, and clinicians. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health care providers and payers need to be aware of the issues surrounding biosimilar and follow-on insulins as they become more widely available in the coming years. In particular, in the face of limited data on comparative safety and efficacy, careful consideration needs to be given when interchanging between originator and biosimilar drugs, when switching patients from one biosimilar drug to the other.

Title: Patient Perspectives on Biosimilar Insulin.
Publication Date: 2014-Jan-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876533
Abstract: Given that a new wave of biosimilar insulins will likely enter the market in coming years, it is important to understand patient perspectives on these biosimilars. A survey (N = 3214) conducted by the market research company dQ&A, which maintains a 10 000-patient panel of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in roughly equal measure, investigated these perspectives. The survey asked whether patients would switch to a hypothetical less expensive biosimilar insulin that was approved by their provider. Approximately 66% of respondents reported that they would "definitely" or "likely" use a biosimilar insulin, while 17% reported that they were "unlikely" to use or would "definitely not use" such a product. Type 2 diabetes patients demonstrated slightly more willingness to use biosimilars than type 1 diabetes patients. Common patient concerns included whether biosimilars would be as effective as reference products (~650 respondents), whether side effect profiles would deviate from those of reference products (~220 respondents), and the design of the delivery device (~50 respondents). While cost savings associated with biosimilar insulins could increase patient uptake, especially among patients without health insurance (some recent estimates suggest that biosimilars will come at a substantial discount), patients may still need assurance that a cheaper price tag is not necessarily associated with substandard quality. Overall, the dQ&A survey indicates that the majority of patients are willing to consider biosimilar insulins, but manufacturers will need to work proactively to address and assuage patient concerns regarding efficacy, safety, drug administration, and other factors.

Title: A descriptive analysis of real-world treatment patterns of innovator (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) and biosimilar infliximab in an infliximab-naïve Turkish population.
Publication Date: 2018-01-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30323555
Abstract: Biosimilar IFX (CT-P13) received marketing approval in Turkey for treatment of rheumatologic diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis. Population data on real-world treatment patterns of CT-P13 following marketing approval in European countries are largely unreported. This study examined the prescribing and medication utilization patterns of innovator infliximab (IFX) and CT-P13 in Turkey for patients with RA or IBD naïve to either IFX.
Adult patients with ≥1 diagnosis claim for RA or IBD and ≥1 claim for IFX or CT-P13 were identified in the Turkish Ministry of Health database during the following identification periods: 1 Oct 2014-30 May 2015 (RA) and 1 Oct 2014-31 Dec 2015 (IBD). Continuous medical and pharmacy coverage for ≥12 months before and after the date of the first dose (index) IFX or CT-P13 was also required. Separate analyses were done for each population.
Seven hundred and seventy nine adult RA and 581 IBD patients met the selection criteria. The majority of RA (74%; n=575) and IBD patients (87%; n=504) were initiated on IFX. The average study observation period was 16 months for the RA and 12 months for the IBD population. Over the observation periods, discontinuation among RA patients occurred in 42% of IFX and 63% of CT-P13 while discontinuation in the IBD cohort occurred in 38% of IFX; and 62% of CT-P13.
In this population-based study, more IFX-naïve RA and IBD patients were initially treated with IFX than CT-P13. Discontinuation and switching were observed more often and earlier among patients treated with CT-P13 regardless of disease state. Further studies are needed to understand the reasons for these observed differences.

Title: Incidence of Serious Infections and Design of Utilization and Safety Studies for Biologic and Biosimilar Surveillance.
Publication Date: 2020-Apr-01
PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223608
Abstract: There is a need for postmarketing evidence generation for novel biologics and biosimilars.
To assess the feasibility, strengths, and limitations of the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) Distributed Research Network (DRN) to examine the utilization and comparative safety of immune-modulating agents among patients with autoimmune diseases.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients enrolled in health insurance plans participating in the BBCIC DRN between January 1, 2006, and September 30, 2015. Eligible patients were adult (≥18 years) new users of a disease-modifying nonbiologic and/or biologic agent with a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other inflammatory conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Follow-up started at treatment initiation and ended at the earliest of outcome occurrence (serious infection); treatment discontinuation; or switching, death, disenrollment, or end of study period. The study leveraged the FDA Sentinel System infrastructure for data management and analysis; descriptive statistics of patient characteristics and unadjusted incidence rates of study outcomes during follow-up were calculated.
Eligible patient drug episodes included 111,611 with RA (75% female), 61,050 with other inflammatory conditions (51% female), and 30,628 with IBD (52% female). Across all 3 cohorts, approximately half of the patient drug episodes initiated a biologic (50% in RA; 60% in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis; and 55% in IBD). The crude incidence rate of serious infection was 9.8 (9.5-10.0) cases per 100 person-years in RA, 7.1 (6.8-7.5) in other inflammatory conditions, and 14.2 (13.6-14.8) in IBD patients.
This study successfully identified large numbers of new users of biologics and produced results that were consistent with those from earlier published studies. The BBCIC DRN is a potential resource for surveillance of biologics.

Transitioning was defined as patients in whom the biosimilar was introduced after the originator, without treatment with other drugs in between. Retransitioning was defined as restarting the originator directly after discontinuing a biosimilar, without treatment with other drugs in between. In summary, transitioning was defined as switching from the originator to a biosimilar; retransitioning was defined as switching from the originator to a biosimilar and back to the originator. Both transitioning and retransitioning involved changes with the same active biological substance.

Eligible patient drug episodes included 111,611 with RA (75% female), 61,050 with other inflammatory conditions (51% female), and 30,628 with IBD (52% female). Across all 3 cohorts, approximately half of the patient drug episodes initiated a biologic (50% in RA; 60% in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis; and 55% in IBD). The crude incidence rate of serious infection was 9.8 (9.5-10.0) cases per 100 person-years in RA, 7.1 (6.8-7.5) in other inflammatory conditions, and 14.2 (13.6-14.8) in IBD patients.
This study successfully identified large numbers of new users of biologics and produced results that were consistent with those from earlier published studies. The BBCIC DRN is a potential resource for surveillance of biologics.
